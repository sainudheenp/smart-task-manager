1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,199
hi everyone welcome back in another

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,920
Amazing Project where we're going to be

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,719
building this task manager application

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,519
so before I start showing you the

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,240
application I want just I want to just

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,759
let you know that I I was heavily

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,439
inspired by this uh lot of small

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,920
application provided by Shad CN to be

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
able to show uh the components but also

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,800
to be able to show the react table

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,640
so this is what they're using to be able

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
to actually uh use this table with all

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,480
the features that we're going to be

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,600
using like sorting filtering and other

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,200
things uh that we're going to be using

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,039
for the application and we're going to

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,039
learn through building this application

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,160
so as you can see here we're having a

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,760
simple nav bar at the top we're having

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,039
the lights and dark mode so it's pretty

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
straightforward we're using uh Shad SC

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,559
for this we're having the dialogue to be

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,000
able to add uh or edit uh a tack I'm

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,960
going to show you how this is working

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,760
we're having these cards to be able show

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,759
to be able to show some numbers so here

27
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,200
in the text or the table area we're

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,240
having the filter so uh if I want to

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,520
look for something as you can see I'm

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,280
going to get uh what I'm searching for

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,320
but if I don't find anything so we are

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,000
going to get this message all of this

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,640
we're using uh react table also we

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,439
can be able to actually um show uh the

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,520
states of the test with their numbers so

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,799
it is pretty much the same like uh

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,320
they're having in here so we're going to

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
build this from scratch so when I click

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,280
on the too so I'm going to just get the

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,439
tasks that uh are uh having the to-do

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,399
stages also notice right now uh we can

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,799
be able to show uh the actual uh filter

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
tag that we clicked on so the same thing

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,320
that it is happen happing in here so

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,200
when I click on the other one we're

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
going to show it uh uh next to it so the

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
same think it's going to happen if I

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
click on the

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
backlog and also we can be able to

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,840
really filter down uh stuff when I click

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,640
on medium So eventually uh because we

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,360
are already filtering by States uh

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,400
there's uh no tou that match the

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
filtering uh the filtering elements that

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,200
we selected but when I click on low so

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,680
we're going to get the two tasks because

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,400
uh it matches uh the the filtering that

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,360
we set and when I click on the reset so

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,000
everything it's going to be reset and

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,599
also we can be able to actually hide the

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,599
columns as you can see and uh also we

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,360
can be able to do it just from here so

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,840
if I had the stitches gon and here as

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,800
you can see it's going to be and shcked

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,280
automatically so and all of this is

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,840
going to be handled by tack react table

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,879
and also we can be able to sort dently

68
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,440
and accidently and decid and also we can

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
be able to do this for the other columns

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
but as you can see the title doesn't

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
have the hide features because if we

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,040
hide it we can't be able to filter uh

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,760
the elements because we're using this

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
colum for the filtering and if this is

75
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
hidden we can't be able to do the

76
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
filtering so that's why we uh enabled

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
the hiding for the title

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
column and uh finally we're having at

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,879
the bottom the bination as you can see

80
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,159
so everything is working as expected so

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,439
now I'm going to show you this little

82
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,120
drop down so this drop down I was

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,640
inspired by the same drop down but I

84
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,760
added some icons just to make the drop-

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,400
down pop a bit and all of the features

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,159
in here so now nothing is working but

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
here everything is working so I'm going

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,079
to start by making a copy for

89
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,200
example when I click on make

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,480
copy so as you can see the actual uh

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
task has been copied

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,239
successfully and if I want to delete

93
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,759
this task all I have to do click on the

94
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
delete and as you can see the task has

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
been deleted successfully with the

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,759
notification now if I want to set it as

97
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
has favorite or unfavorite so uh the

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,800
thing that I added though is the

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,639
favorite so I can be able to set for

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,080
example this task as favorite so when I

101
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,160
click on favorite so it's going to be

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,720
set as favorite and this it's going to

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,440
be changing dependent on whether it is

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,479
favorite or not so if it is favorite

105
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,479
it's going we're going to show the INF

106
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,280
favorite text otherwise we're going to

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,440
show the

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
favorite and here we can be able to

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,360
actually uh Define or update the the the

110
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,000
bug uh the label story just from here so

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,280
the same thing if we do for this

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,360
application so I'm going to set it as

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,479
documentation so everything is working

114
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,120
fine and finally we're having the edit

115
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,560
and uh so before that I'm going to just

116
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,199
show you how we can be able to add a new

117
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,880
task so when I click on ADD so I'm going

118
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,840
to add something in here just to show

119
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,840
how things are work in and I'm going to

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,759
just uh update the elements in here and

121
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,199
click on

122
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,319
ADD so as you can see the task has been

123
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,639
added successfully and I can be able to

124
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,960
update it of course so when I click on

125
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,319
update so we're going

126
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,039
to use the same dialogue but I'm going

127
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,960
to actually load all the information of

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,680
the test that we click on so I'm going

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,039
to add some stuff in here I'm going to

130
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,960
change some of the elements just to uh

131
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,479
see that everything is working

132
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,440
so uh as you can see uh everything like

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,759
the task has been edited uh

134
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,840
successfully so uh so this is what we're

135
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,240
going to be building for this

136
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,919
application so if you are interested

137
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,280
about building this application stick

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,479
with me till the end of this

139
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,520
video hi everyone welcome back so as you

140
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
can see I'm in Visual Studio code and I

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,240
already created the nextjs project so

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm going to walk you through uh step by

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,479
step very quickly just to show you how

144
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,639
to be able to do this since a lot of

145
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,400
people know how to create this and if

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,319
you are new to uh this whole word so

147
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,280
don't worry I'm going to show you step

148
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,599
by step how to do so so uh the first

149
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,479
thing that I'm going to start from is

150
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,880
the uh nextjs uh website and uh so uh go

151
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,240
to the doc section so in here uh they

152
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,440
are showing us the STS needed to be able

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,840
to install nextjs so the first thing

154
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,400
that you should have in your system is

155
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,039
not JS so if we go to their website or

156
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
the page I'll just to show you uh what

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,360
it looks like so make sure to download

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,440
this and install it inur System since

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,120
nextjs use for the back end s uses uh

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,479
not J uh not

161
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,879
JS so after installing njs the next

162
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,240
thing uh so so that's the uh terminal or

163
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,599
the uh command line to install nextjs so

164
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,400
copy this and open up your terminal and

165
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,000
uh so I'm going to go to another window

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
so and just paste it in here and hit

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
enter so after uh hitting enter so you

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
will have the following prompts so just

169
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,680
stick with the default ones so we're

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,039
going to use of course typescript ESL J

171
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,479
CSS uh the Source directory I'm not

172
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,560
going to use it we're going to just

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,319
stick with the app directory for the

174
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
remaining uh questions just just stick

175
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,879
with the default options so uh then it's

176
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,840
going to install all the dependencies

177
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,599
needed to make sure that the project is

178
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
working so after doing this all you have

179
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,159
to do I'm start installing all the the

180
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,720
dependencies just type in npm run div

181
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,879
and uh you ready to go the application

182
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,199
is going to run so

183
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,200
uh as you can see my application is

184
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,320
already running and uh with the Local

185
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,240
Host 3000 so we will have this uh

186
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,760
default page provided by nextjs and this

187
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,080
is the uh code of it of course we need

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
to delete all of this code so we're not

189
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
going to need it so we're going to just

190
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,959
create uh empty div like this and we're

191
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,399
going to get rid from the

192
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,440
image uh uh object uh which is provided

193
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,120
by nextjs to be able to optimize images

194
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,399
so after showing you how to be able to

195
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,000
install nextjs so it's very simple the

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
next thing that I'm going to show you is

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
how to be able to

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,120
install um uh Shad CN so we're going to

199
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,920
go to the shaten

200
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,079
website so my connection is pretty slow

201
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,240
uh these days so I don't know why so

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,839
we're willing to uh load uh the page so

203
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
in the Shad CN so we're going to go to

204
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,880
the homepage so we're going to go to the

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,720
installation and the

206
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,880
nextjs uh which is the framework that

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,800
we're using and uh the first step we're

208
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
going to copy this and uh we're go back

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,519
to vs code and so I'm going to show you

210
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,079
uh what I did and what you would uh have

211
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,240
in into the terminal when you hit enter

212
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
so after doing this it's going to

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,040
install uh all uh so it's going to

214
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,200
verify next jss is installed J One CSS

215
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,160
uh validate the importas verifying the

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,440
component. Json which is this file which

217
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,360
is the uh core element of Shad

218
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,800
CN and then uh it's going to update the

219
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,920
ch. config.js and also the global. CSS

220
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
so if we go to the global. CSS so this

221
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,680
is the code that has been added by Shad

222
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,360
CN so to be able to make sure that um

223
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,240
all the uh the theme it's going to be

224
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,120
it's going to be unified inside our

225
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,720
whole project wherever that uh we are

226
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,600
using uh or whatever the component that

227
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,480
we're using inside the project and also

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,839
another thing that I did is I downgrade

229
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,200
it to the react 18 since still have so

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,680
you may have this warning issue uh which

231
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
is this one so to avoid this since I'm

232
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
not going to use any features or new

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,519
features from react 19 I'm going to

234
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,000
stick with the react 18 and uh to be

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,279
able to do this go to the package.json

236
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,160
sorry and here just uh replace uh 18

237
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
instead of 19 and also make sure to

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
place the types for the react to avoid

239
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,040
having some mismatch and some errors

240
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,800
with TP script if you lit uh the this 19

241
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
and you're using actually uh 18 react

242
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,920
version 18 of

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,600
react so uh this is uh the uh setup that

244
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,839
I did and last time I'm going to show

245
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,160
you since I'm going to use uh popins

246
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,680
font which is the Popin or the font that

247
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,600
I use for all my project so it's very

248
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,680
simple go to the layout. gs6 and add the

249
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,519
popins object from this package and here

250
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,720
we're going to create this concept with

251
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,440
this object and we're going to be adding

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,639
all of these

253
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,160
properties and we're going to add the

254
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
poppins. variable inside the class name

255
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
of the body tag and finally in the

256
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,480
global. CSS make sure to add the Poppins

257
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,000
class and we're going to use the

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,279
variable that we created in here so

259
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,199
we're going to use it by using the V

260
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,880
method and the uh CSS so and uh if you

261
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,880
want to use so I'm going to add here the

262
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,240
class popins which is the class uh that

263
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
we created and I'm going to add

264
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,199
something in here and hit enter and

265
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,240
let's go back to the uh actual browser

266
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,760
and uh so as you can see the

267
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,199
uh the uh font has been applied

268
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,600
successfully so this is how we can this

269
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,199
is the set of our project so the next

270
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,880
thing that I'm going to be that I'm

271
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
going to add in the project is the nav

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
bar bar so before we add the naar to the

273
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,279
application so the next thing that uh we

274
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,880
should be installing is the dark mode so

275
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,160
we're going to use Shad CN so they're

276
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,240
providing uh package to be able to add

277
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,320
the dark mode to the project uh if you

278
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
are using shedan of course so just go to

279
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,440
the dark mode you can go to the search

280
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,279
uh to the search bar and just typee in

281
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,199
dark

282
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,480
mode So eventually that's the

283
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,399
page and uh choose next shes of course

284
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
so this is the step by step guide to be

285
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
able to install the dark mode so we're

286
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,920
going to well so we're going to follow

287
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,199
all these steps here so the first thing

288
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
that we should be doing so we're going

289
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
to use since we're using the npn package

290
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,800
so just copy this so go back to the

291
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
terminal and I'm going to open up the

292
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
terminal and pasted the actual package

293
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
so it's going to be installing the

294
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
package for us so it's going to take a

295
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,320
little bit of time uh because of my

296
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,680
connection speed it's uh a bit low

297
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,160
so after installing the package as you

298
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
can see it has been install installed

299
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,519
successfully so now let's go back to the

300
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,480
page so the next thing that we're going

301
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
to be doing is creating this theme

302
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
provider uh which is a component that we

303
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,560
are going to wrap uh our uh body uh

304
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,880
uh uh tag in the layout. GSX so let's

305
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,440
copy this and uh so we're going to go

306
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,480
back to the app folder so here we're

307
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,759
going to create the file same provider.

308
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,759
GSX and I'm going to paste the code and

309
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,920
save the file so let's go back to the

310
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,560
page so the first or the third step as I

311
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,000
said we need to wrap the uh the

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,839
children uh with the team provider that

313
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,160
we just

314
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,360
created so uh what what I'm going to do

315
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm going to just copy this and I'm

316
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,120
going to go to the layout.

317
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
GSS and I'm going to take this part I'm

318
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,279
going to paste it in here so we're

319
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,519
having this red line

320
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,639
because uh it doesn't know where to

321
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,680
import the component

322
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,319
so I'm going to add it like this so uh

323
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,440
vs code is going to do it for us to be

324
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
able to import the component from the

325
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,399
file that we created in here and let's

326
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,680
save the file so let's go back to the

327
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,880
page so we're going to add this uh

328
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,199
toggle so all you have to do just copy

329
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,480
this code so I've already created this

330
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,079
and just paste it in here so so I'm

331
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,639
going to do it

332
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
again and uh you will have this issues

333
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,040
uh these issues uh since it is uh

334
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,160
complaining about these components

335
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,040
because we didn't install yet this

336
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,360
component these components the button

337
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,360
and the drop down menu so uh let's do

338
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,279
this so let's go to the Shad CN website

339
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,480
and I'm going to look for the button so

340
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
all you have to do just copy this and

341
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,600
open up the terminal and hit

342
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,160
enter so uh it's going to install the

343
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,039
components uh so um I think I'm going

344
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,240
it's going to create a new folder called

345
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,559
uh components so we are waiting to do

346
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,559
this

347
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,000
so the button has been installed

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,760
successfully and uh as you can see we're

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,919
having a new folder called components

350
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,919
and inside of it we're having the UI

351
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,400
folder and this is the button. TSX

352
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,520
component so this is the main component

353
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,840
of the button and this is the whole code

354
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,240
so as you can see it's pretty lengthy

355
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,799
and uh all of this has been provided for

356
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,400
us uh to be able to uh to not focus on

357
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,960
the UI and just focus on the uh the

358
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,159
features of the project and make the

359
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,880
process of building the project lot

360
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,760
faster so the next element that we need

361
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,840
to install is the drop- down menu so

362
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,799
here I'm going to search for the drop

363
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,600
down menu

364
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,880
and we're going to do the same thing

365
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,760
copy this and so let me clear the

366
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,679
terminal and I'm going to paste the

367
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,600
command line and hit enter and it's

368
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,559
going to do pretty much the same to be

369
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,159
able to install a new component inside

370
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,240
the components

371
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
folder for

372
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
so our drop- down component has been

373
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
installed successfully and notice right

374
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,240
now we're having a new file and as you

375
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,200
can see uh the errors uh gone so uh

376
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,960
nothing uh so there's no issue in the

377
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,200
component so we can be able to call this

378
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,440
component uh successfully so if we go to

379
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
the page. GSS so let's delete this and

380
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm going to add the

381
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
component like

382
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
this so I think that the name of the

383
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
actual component is the mode togle so

384
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm going to just copy

385
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,120
this or just let me do this

386
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,880
and hit enter and if we go back to the

387
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,880
page so as you can see our our uh

388
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,799
component is uh working and our dark

389
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,400
mode is working so uh once we are going

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,679
to add the nav bar so it's going to to

391
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,080
be added at the right side so uh anyway

392
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
our dark mode as you can see is working

393
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,080
successfully so let's move to the next

394
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,960
part which is building our nav bar so

395
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,559
this is the header of the application so

396
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
it's very simple and basic hiter so

397
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
we're having the logo the application

398
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
the name so this is the name that I

399
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,600
chose for the application the button uh

400
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,799
to be able to add a new task and uh the

401
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,760
drop- down menu that I showed you to be

402
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,960
able to switch from light to dark mode

403
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
and vice

404
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,960
versa so uh so this is the nav bar and

405
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
uh also I want to show you how to be

406
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,880
able to change the colors so uh to be

407
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,240
able to do so so uh go to the uh theme

408
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,279
section and uh click on customize and

409
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,200
you can be able to choose any color that

410
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
you want so I choose the rose color and

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,039
uh click on copy code and copy all of

412
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,640
this code and uh go to the global. CSS

413
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,840
and just replace the default code with

414
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,080
the the code uh so let's assume that

415
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,760
this is the default code just delete

416
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,720
this and uh so let me copy this

417
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,240
again and paste it in here and save the

418
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,480
global. CSS so uh the next thing that I

419
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,799
did is I created a new folder called

420
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,320
components so we're going to be adding

421
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,200
all the uh components of the project

422
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
inside this folder and this is the file

423
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,279
nav bar

424
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,520
GSX so uh here so we are doing some

425
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,080
couple of imports so uh we're importing

426
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,919
this for the icon and the use team Hook

427
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,640
from the next team uh package that we

428
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,159
installed for the dark mode and I'm

429
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,400
going to show you why so this is for the

430
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,880
uh for the drop- down uh dark mode

431
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,760
toggle and finally the button so this is

432
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
the functional component the nav bar and

433
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
here we are uh destructing the use theme

434
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,320
to be able to access to the theme so you

435
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,200
can know uh which uh state that the

436
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,799
theme is in uh so uh so this is what

437
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,640
we're doing here so if the theme is dark

438
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,120
we are going to use this black uh this

439
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,000
background black color and the border at

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,760
the top and uh by the way those are just

441
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,559
uh tell utility classes otherwise it's

442
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,360
going to be background white so we're

443
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,640
going to use the background color and

444
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,279
we're going to paste whatever returned

445
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,720
in here inside the class name so that's

446
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
why we're adding the back ticks and the

447
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,559
kly braces to make sure that this is

448
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,360
going to be read as a variable not as a

449
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,360
string and those are just the utility

450
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,000
classes to make sure that this nav bar

451
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,159
it's going to have all the

452
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,520
uh all the uh styling necessary to be

453
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,880
able to make sure that uh we're going to

454
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,799
have this layout for the na bar so we're

455
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,000
having the width is fold and the height

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,760
it's going to be fixed uh the Overflow

457
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,520
hidden to justify between so to make

458
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,960
sure that these elements are going to be

459
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,600
POS positioned automatically like this

460
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,120
the pixel so we added some uh some

461
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,080
padding at at the left and at the right

462
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,279
and the bottom it's going to be we're

463
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,919
going to have some border at the bottom

464
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,960
and finally the background color that I

465
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
showed you so next we're having the uh

466
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,440
this component it's going to render only

467
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,760
the icon and the name so here we're

468
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,520
having the header tck with these utility

469
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,360
classes we're having this icon wrapper

470
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,840
so we're going to use the size 9 which

471
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,159
is a utility class

472
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,919
uh from uh uh chn CSS uh just to be able

473
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,399
to shortcut stuff without using or add

474
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,679
in more utility classes so it's going to

475
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,480
do this with and height with the uh 39

476
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
pixel each the background is going to be

477
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,159
primary rounded uh so it's going to be

478
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:21,760
medium flag justify Center and item

479
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,279
Center so you can be able to Center the

480
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:27,720
icon within this icon wrapper and this

481
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,320
is the icon on and finally this is the

482
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
name of the application so we're using

483
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,679
the H1 tag with all of these classes and

484
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,480
we're using the board in another spin uh

485
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
because the word task it's going to be

486
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,159
bold and this one it's not going to be

487
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,200
bold so and uh of course we need to uh

488
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,480
import this uh right here and finally at

489
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
the right side we're having the add task

490
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,640
button and the drop to down so right now

491
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
it's just a Buton because we need to add

492
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,840
the dialogue component for this so we're

493
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,080
going to do this later and we're having

494
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,320
the mode toggle component that I showed

495
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,399
you uh when we installed the dark mode

496
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,840
theme so we're going to import the

497
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,240
component like this and we are going to

498
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,840
make sure that these are going to be

499
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,240
within one div to make sure that these

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,440
elements are going to be positioned like

501
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,880
this automatically since we're using the

502
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,440
just y between uh the justify between uh

503
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,320
utility class so this is how we can

504
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,320
create the na bar and also make sure to

505
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,000
use the use client so uh it should be a

506
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,080
client component and because we're using

507
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,440
a use team hook here and of course we

508
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,640
should be able to import and render the

509
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,080
nav bar component so all you have to do

510
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,679
go to the page. GSX and import or use

511
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,840
the nav bar bar component in here to be

512
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
able to render it inside the uh homepage

513
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,120
so after we added the nav bar the second

514
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,880
element that I added all of these cards

515
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,399
these three cards so we're having the uh

516
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,640
so this is the design of each card and

517
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,720
also we're have in here the uh disc card

518
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,600
is going to show the total number of

519
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,399
tasks completed tasks and the high

520
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:26,200
priority tasks and also as you can see

521
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,440
the background it's going to be uh uh

522
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,919
it's going to have a kind of a slate uh

523
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:37,039
color uh so I'm going to show you how to

524
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,360
create this so uh first inside the

525
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,840
components folder so I created the stats

526
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
cards. GSX you can call it whatever you

527
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,159
want so here we are going to import all

528
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,000
of these elements so uh the first thing

529
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,360
that uh we need to do uh since we're

530
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,559
going to use the card component in our

531
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,799
GSA as you can see for each card so we

532
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,720
need to install the card component so

533
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,679
make sure to copy this and paste this in

534
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,960
your terminal and hit enter and you

535
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,360
should have the card. TSX inside the

536
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,440
components folder of Shad

537
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
CN and also make sure to install react

538
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,039
icons so uh Shaden uses the Lucid react

539
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,120
library but also there are some icons

540
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,840
that I love that are in the react icons

541
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,120
Library so so here uh just type in npm

542
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,240
install react icons so this is the name

543
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,039
of the library hit enter and it's going

544
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
to be installed

545
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,080
so uh after this we are going to set the

546
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,559
definition or we're going to define the

547
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,240
structure of each card so we're having

548
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,000
the title the value and the icon so the

549
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,640
icon it's going to be of react of type

550
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,760
react note and then we're g we're having

551
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,919
this array so for each object it's going

552
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,799
to represent each card so uh

553
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,720
normally uh what I should do here I

554
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,120
should add the single card

555
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,480
type and I'm going to add the girly

556
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,640
braces uh the bracket sorry since it's

557
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,159
uh an array so here we're having the

558
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,519
title the value and the icon based on

559
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,760
the def

560
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,720
that we created for each

561
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,559
card so after we created our array so

562
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,240
then we are going to uh use this stats

563
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,399
map and we're going to map through each

564
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,799
element and we're going to call this

565
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,440
single stat card and we're going to pass

566
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,519
for each object we're going to pass it

567
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,080
as a promp uh that I called single card

568
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,480
as you can see here and we're going to

569
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,120
take this promp and we're going to use

570
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,960
it inside the single state stat card to

571
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,799
be able to render each object and here

572
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,320
we're using some utility classes so

573
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,679
we're using the grid uh display and the

574
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,080
grid colum is three and also we're using

575
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,519
the media query just to make sure that

576
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,240
this is going to be uh dynamic as you

577
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
can see when the size of the uh of the

578
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,519
window changes so they are at the top of

579
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,279
each other so because we use the media

580
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,679
queries here here a little bit of margin

581
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,279
at the top some gap between each card

582
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,840
and also a little bit of padding and uh

583
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,679
here uh I'm going I'm going to explain

584
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:41,919
uh what's inside the single stat card so

585
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,240
we're having the main uh the main tag or

586
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,679
the main component which is card that we

587
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,880
installed from Shad CN so I did this so

588
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,640
you can be able to uh when I turn the

589
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
dark mode on as you can see it's going

590
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
to handle the changing of the color

591
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,360
automatically since uh it is used or it

592
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,559
is part of the Shad Cen

593
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,519
ecosystem so that's why I used uh the

594
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,720
card component so we're using the

595
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
utility classes here and we're getting

596
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,519
from the shadow so we are we added the

597
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,120
shadow non utility class or utility

598
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,519
class sorry so first we're having the

599
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,360
hitter and we're having the value so

600
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,320
here uh if we turn the light mode on

601
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,440
back so we're having the heer we're

602
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,360
having the name of the card and also the

603
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,760
icon so this is what we're having so

604
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,760
this is the name of the card and this is

605
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,880
the icon wrapper with all of these

606
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,960
utility classes as you can see it is a

607
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,159
pretty

608
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,000
long and uh finally we're having the the

609
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,880
value so we're taking each uh property

610
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,039
of the single card object and so we

611
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,240
could uh this destruct the single card

612
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,760
in a in a in a uh in a constant and then

613
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,360
we can be able to use it uh but if you

614
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
want you can be able to use directly the

615
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
single card object and use the

616
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
properties depending where you want to

617
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,519
place this into the uh component so this

618
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
is basically how we can be able to

619
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,519
create this and also make make sure to

620
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,519
use the use client uh to use the use

621
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,080
client to make it a client component so

622
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,240
if we go so let me save the file so we

623
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,159
need to import this in the main uh

624
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,000
functional component of our

625
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,240
application and uh here also I I added

626
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,679
the uh use team hook like we did for the

627
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,200
nav bar since if uh uh so here as you

628
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,159
can see the background it's not going to

629
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:51,600
be white so it's going to be uh this

630
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,440
color background slate and to be able to

631
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,000
uh to go with the uh actual ual next te

632
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,519
package that handles the dark mode so we

633
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,639
need to do this the same thing that we

634
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:08,559
did for the nav bar and here I added the

635
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,320
popins font and also the uh this utility

636
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,200
class for the uh for the for the height

637
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,480
and finally we're adding whatever that

638
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,720
we turn the background color constant

639
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,039
inside the class name to be able to

640
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,120
apply the color when we switch uh to the

641
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,080
dark mode or the light mode so after we

642
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,840
added the statistic course the next

643
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,159
element that I added is this uh cord

644
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,000
where we're going to be uh adding uh the

645
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,039
uh search input and also uh the table

646
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,639
and also are going to be adding the

647
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,720
dropdowns but first I want to just show

648
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,440
you how to create this and then we're

649
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,480
going to uh I'm going to show you uh

650
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,440
step by step all the other components

651
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,960
so um the first thing that we need to do

652
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,679
we need to install the input component

653
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,760
from Shad CN so again just

654
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,320
uh open up your terminal and add this

655
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,480
command line in here and hit enter and

656
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,800
you should have the input. GSX inside

657
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,560
the comp components folder uh sorry so

658
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,560
uh here if we go to the page. GSX so

659
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,320
we're going to have the tasks area

660
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,480
component

661
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,839
so this is the new component and this

662
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,320
component is coming from this file so I

663
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
create because we're going to be adding

664
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,679
other components inside the uh task uh

665
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,760
area so just to organize things so I

666
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,280
added the task area folder so we're

667
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,639
having the search input and the task

668
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,599
area so the search input so it's very

669
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,079
basic component so we're going to use

670
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,000
the input component from Shad CN so the

671
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,440
top it's going to be text I uh I made

672
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,359
the high a little bit uh uh so I I

673
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:08,359
changed the the height so to make the

674
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,480
actual

675
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,720
input uh to have uh the height a little

676
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,440
bit bigger then the place folder or the

677
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,079
placeholder filter by task and we need

678
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,920
to export this because we need to use it

679
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,599
instead the task area component so these

680
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,200
are the actual inputs that we're going

681
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
to use for this component so this is the

682
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,880
structure or the basic uh structure of

683
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,760
the task area so as you can see I added

684
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,520
some comment just uh to know

685
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,200
uh uh uh where uh like the structure uh

686
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,880
the uh structure of the components but

687
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,040
also I added these comments so this is

688
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,240
where I'm going to place the future

689
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,680
components so we're having the card the

690
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,160
card header and also we're having the

691
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,280
search input which is the component that

692
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,720
I just showed you and in this part we're

693
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,880
going to show or to actually create the

694
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,599
stat just drop down on the priority uh

695
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,240
drop down and here we're having inside

696
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,440
the button the reset button with its

697
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,880
icon so we're going to use this button

698
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,560
to be able to reset the uh filter and

699
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
also we're going to add here the drop

700
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,119
down view colum to be able to eliminate

701
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,880
or hide some of the col if you want and

702
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,599
inside the card content so we're going

703
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,319
to add the actual table by using CH

704
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:32,560
stack table and finally at the bottom in

705
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,319
the future we're going to add a

706
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,760
component called the pagination area to

707
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,400
be able to handle the pagination by

708
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,240
using Chan

709
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,640
stack and we are going to import this

710
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,079
component right at the bottom of the

711
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,319
main component which is the uh home

712
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:54,400
component to be able to render it like

713
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,040
this so after we created the task area

714
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,880
so the first component that I added is

715
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,839
this drop down so here we are going to

716
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,480
show the uh

717
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,560
priority uh uh TXS that the user filters

718
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,160
by and uh so when I click on here as you

719
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,079
can see I'm going to see this drop down

720
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,319
or this command component to be able to

721
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:23,520
actually select the priority that I want

722
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,560
so the same uh the same that has been

723
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,200
been used in the task component as you

724
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,440
can see so when I click on here so we're

725
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,359
going to have uh the um actual uh tags

726
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,839
that we filter by uh stages so now of

727
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,040
course uh I'm I'm I'm I'm just laying

728
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,920
out uh things how they're looking but

729
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,200
when we start working on uh using the

730
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
stage management and making the

731
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,160
application working so we're going to

732
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,839
have the just priority and whenever the

733
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,400
uh user clicks on here then we can be

734
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
able to show the medium or the high

735
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,319
depending on what the user clicked

736
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,800
on so uh the first thing we need to

737
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
install some components so here if I

738
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,839
open up the terminal so uh you can find

739
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,480
that I installed many components so so

740
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
the first component that we should be

741
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,240
installing is the command component so

742
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,440
this this is the component that we are

743
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,040
going to use to be able to show uh this

744
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,640
part so it is the command component so

745
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,160
make sure to just copy this and paste it

746
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,160
in terminal and hit enter so you should

747
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,760
have the command. GSX inside the

748
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,240
components folder next uh the next

749
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:56,000
component is the uh badge and uh

750
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,839
also um so let me open up the drop down

751
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,720
so we're having the command component

752
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,560
the popover component so if we go to the

753
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,200
popover

754
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,760
component so this is so the popover

755
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,720
component it's basically it's going to

756
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,839
allow us to actually open up the command

757
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,400
uh component right when we click

758
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,800
so we they're just giving us an example

759
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,040
just to uh show you what what it does so

760
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
just copy this command line and paste it

761
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,359
into a terminal and next we need to

762
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,920
install the

763
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,319
checkbox so go again into the Shad CN

764
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,440
website and copy this and paste it in

765
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,319
terminal then we're having the separator

766
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:51,319
and the badge so again type in here

767
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,240
separator so you should find this this

768
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,760
one copy this and P in terminal the

769
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,359
batch component so also we're going to

770
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,760
use the batch component which uh are

771
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,640
these two elements so they're using the

772
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,440
badge component as I'm going to show you

773
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,720
in the

774
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,520
GSX so here we are just importing all

775
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,200
the elements needed for this component

776
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,200
to be working so the first thing we are

777
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,480
Define the structure of each stages and

778
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,880
we're creating the array so this is the

779
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,680
area that we are creating so the objects

780
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,480
going to have the value the label and

781
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,119
the icon is going to be of Icon type

782
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,560
which is from the react icons

783
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,280
Library so this is the component so

784
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,119
we're having the open the set open uh to

785
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,400
be able to handle the opening or the

786
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,720
closing of the pop over so as you can

787
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,640
see we are going to add them here in the

788
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,280
pop over component so uh when uh the uh

789
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,760
open state changes it's going to call

790
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,520
the set open and implicitly uh so this

791
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,200
is the arrow function uh if we over over

792
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
the onop change it has

793
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,359
this uh this uh sign function signature

794
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,240
that has the open of tyoon so uh

795
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,000
eventually it's going to handle the open

796
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,680
and the closing of the component uh

797
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,839
automatically so we're having the pop

798
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,640
over trigger uh that is going to

799
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,319
actually trigger uh whatever that we are

800
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,280
putting inside the popover content so

801
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,680
I'm going to get into this so here we're

802
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,079
going to add this button so this button

803
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,280
which which is this uh whole element so

804
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,240
we're having the icon priority we're

805
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,079
having the separator and the Jacks so uh

806
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
here uh the variant it's going to be

807
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,240
outline uh we're not going to use the

808
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,880
default variant of the button and uh

809
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,119
we're have having the uh parent div here

810
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,400
so we're having the priority label with

811
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
the icon the circle plus icon we're

812
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,920
having the separator and we're having

813
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,040
the

814
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,480
badges and uh so this is for the popover

815
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,079
trigger for the pop over content inside

816
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,119
of it you can add whatever you want that

817
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,319
you want to show when we click on the

818
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,640
pop over but here we're going to show

819
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,280
the command uh components so if we go

820
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,160
back to the Shaden and open up the

821
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,240
command component so basically what I do

822
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,520
is I just copy this and I based it in

823
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,200
the code I'm just uh kind of tweaking it

824
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,160
to uh actually get the results that I

825
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,079
want but the most important thing here

826
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,640
is to understand what the code is doing

827
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,319
so first so this is the structure so you

828
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,839
need to follow this structure to make

829
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,280
this work so we're having at the top uh

830
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,720
the command component the command input

831
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,599
which is the input that we're having in

832
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:05,280
here so that's the input uh to be able

833
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,760
to actually uh search for the priority

834
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,160
that we want and uh here we're having

835
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,520
the command list and uh

836
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,880
uh like next to it we're having the

837
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,599
command empty so for example if it

838
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,319
doesn't find anything it's going to

839
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:25,559
return no results found so it is handled

840
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,640
for us by using the command empty tag

841
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,160
then we're having the command group

842
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,720
where we're going to be adding for each

843
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,040
to be able to render each item we're

844
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,440
going to use the command item so

845
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,119
basically the difference between here

846
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,400
and this component is because here we're

847
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,480
going to use so instead of just

848
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,359
hardcoding each object or each command

849
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,680
item and to make uh to make uh uh the

850
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,200
code uh clean we're going to use the

851
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,119
status. mop and then for each object

852
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,160
then we're going to use the command item

853
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,200
so this is why we created the status

854
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,160
array at the top so we can be able to

855
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,160
save some code here by using the map

856
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,319
function so then we're going to use the

857
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,359
command item so we're going to pass in

858
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,720
the states here as a value so we're

859
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,319
going to use the value property of the

860
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,119
status object and the value prop

861
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,559
property of the command item tag so here

862
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,119
we're using the class name justify

863
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,400
between uh because here we're having two

864
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,920
elements we're having this part and this

865
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,640
part to make sure that they're going to

866
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,280
look like this automatically we're going

867
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,559
to use the justify between and the

868
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,839
unselect property it's going to handle

869
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,400
the selection whenever we uh actually

870
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,480
click on the uh stages so if we open up

871
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,720
the log

872
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,160
so let's clear that out and if I click

873
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,960
on here so as you can see we're going to

874
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,079
have because I'm logging out the status

875
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
uh the selected States state so we're

876
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
going to log out the object that we

877
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
clicked

878
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,520
on but eventually when we are going to

879
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,440
start making this functionable all of

880
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,359
this it's going to be updated and of

881
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,480
course I'm going to explain everything

882
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,400
that I did and then uh so uh at the in

883
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,040
the uh left or the right part we're

884
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,000
having the checkbox so uh we're having

885
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,240
the uh status icon and we're having the

886
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,240
label at the left part sorry so and at

887
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,119
the right part we're having the number

888
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,160
of course this is going to be changing

889
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,800
as well uh when we are going to add the

890
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
uh statistic data which are the tasks So

891
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,440
eventually this is going to be updated

892
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,920
so this is practically uh the dropdown

893
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,079
the priority drop down that we created

894
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:58,640
and as you can see it is working

895
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,359
smoothly and it is looking uh good so

896
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,800
after we created the priority drop down

897
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,160
the next element that I added is the

898
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,000
status so uh as you can see we're going

899
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,480
to have the uh statuses that we want to

900
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,400
filter by and also I added this simple

901
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,000
drop down to be able to actually uh hide

902
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,720
or show the

903
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,599
icons so uh let's go back to the the vs

904
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,160
code and I'm going to start from the

905
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
drop- down folder so as you can see I

906
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,400
added the two files so this one for the

907
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,040
status drop down and basically we're

908
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,880
going to uh follow the same uh structure

909
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,240
that we did for the property drop down

910
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,839
so it is pretty much the same so the

911
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,680
only thing that we're going to change is

912
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,800
the

913
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,960
statuses uh area so these are the object

914
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,720
that we're going to use

915
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,280
and uh basically we are going to follow

916
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,280
the same uh pattern that we did for uh

917
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,559
the priority drop down so I'm not going

918
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:10,640
to explain this twice and uh you could

919
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,359
create one component and reuse it but

920
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,480
it's going to make things a bit more

921
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,720
complicated so that's why I added this

922
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,559
so it might be redundant for some of you

923
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:26,240
uh but just to make sure that think are

924
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,400
simple

925
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,680
uh so that's why I created it in another

926
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,480
uh

927
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,200
component and uh finally we're having

928
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,520
the view colums drop down so basically

929
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,240
this is the the actual uh component so I

930
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,319
didn't use the M function just to make

931
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,040
things simple but here I should create

932
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,240
an array and also map through each

933
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,640
element to be able to actually show each

934
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,839
uh each uh uh each item but uh BAS

935
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:00,160
basically what I did I just uh went to

936
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,040
the drop down

937
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:09,559
menu um uh website here and I just uh

938
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,280
so so let

939
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,359
me probably I took this component so

940
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,880
this is the component that I took and I

941
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,839
paste it in here I just Chang uh the

942
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,880
names uh

943
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,920
actually so uh we're going to update

944
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,359
this later on we start making this uh

945
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,880
functionable or the whole application uh

946
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,359
functionable so uh this is basically how

947
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,359
we created this part and this part so

948
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:42,119
the next element that we're going to be

949
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,200
adding is the actual table and the next

950
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,440
thing uh that I added as you can see is

951
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,040
the table so this is the uh final

952
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,960
version of the table so we're having the

953
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,839
task and the title the states the

954
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:03,480
priority and the uh date of creation and

955
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,240
the uh in this part or in this column

956
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,960
we're going to be adding the uh drop

957
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,079
down to be able to uh to change uh uh

958
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,200
some of the things in each task and also

959
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,240
when I click on the uh on the column so

960
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,599
we're going to have this drop down to be

961
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:26,799
able to uh sort Sly or desly or even if

962
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:31,480
want to to hide uh the colum uh so it is

963
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,000
the uh same if we go to the Shaden

964
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,839
website so the tasks so we're going to

965
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:41,359
have the same thing in here so the only

966
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,720
thing that is different is the colums or

967
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,119
the icons but it doesn't matter so the

968
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,359
most important thing here is to know how

969
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,319
this is

970
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,280
working so uh the first thing that we're

971
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,000
going to start from is this page data

972
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,559
table page

973
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:01,280
so uh they're giving us uh really uh

974
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,200
indepth uh sort of in-depth guide to be

975
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,960
able to install the tack table along

976
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,160
with the table component provided by

977
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,319
Shad Cen so uh the first thing that we

978
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,599
should be doing we should be installing

979
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,640
the table component and the tasta

980
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,559
component so make sure to copy these uh

981
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,200
command lines so I've already done this

982
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,680
so as you can see I uh added the table

983
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,720
component but also the chance stack

984
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,680
react table uh Library into the

985
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,520
project so after this I'm going to or

986
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,240
the first step we need to define the

987
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,079
data so since we're going to use only

988
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,559
static data we're not going to use uh

989
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,319
the uh the back end so the first thing

990
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,440
that I did I created this folder called

991
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,640
data and the TK data so this is the

992
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,599
actual data along with the the types of

993
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,599
the elements uh that we're going to use

994
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,880
in in each uh task so for the label so

995
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,240
we're going to use the union types along

996
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,960
with the literal types uh for type

997
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,440
safety so the label is going to be only

998
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,480
bug and feature and documentation the

999
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,559
priority is going to be low medium and

1000
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,880
high and the stages are it's going to be

1001
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,720
all of these uh literal

1002
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,799
types so for each task so we're going to

1003
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:28,920
Define it that way the task ID the title

1004
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,400
the label the is favorite so if we go uh

1005
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,720
back to our website or to our

1006
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,760
application so we're going to have this

1007
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,559
icon to be able to set a task as

1008
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,240
favorite or not favorite something that

1009
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,720
I added that is not here so just uh

1010
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,319
something that I added into the

1011
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:50,240
application so we're having the priority

1012
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,640
so the pr priority it's going to take

1013
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,559
it's going to be of type priority so to

1014
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,920
make sure that the priority only it's

1015
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,599
going to allow this literal typ so

1016
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,160
that's why we defined this as the

1017
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,680
priority and States so the same thing

1018
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,480
we're going to use the status type that

1019
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,160
we defined in here and the created date

1020
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
it's going to be of type date and of

1021
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,960
course the tasks area it's going to be

1022
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,880
of type tasks with the brackets uh tell

1023
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,880
on the types squ this is going to be an

1024
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,640
area of type task that we defined in

1025
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,079
here and these are the objects that we

1026
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,960
are using using um to be able to show

1027
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,760
the table or all the tasks inside the

1028
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,040
table so this is the first step and the

1029
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,000
Second Step so if we close this so uh

1030
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,680
and if we go to the task area folder so

1031
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,720
what I added I added the uh tasks column

1032
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,839
and also I added the task table so let's

1033
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,760
start with the task colum so if we go

1034
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,839
back to their website so so the first

1035
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,280
requirement uh or the first thing that

1036
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,760
that they are starting with is the

1037
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,119
colon. G6 eventually so it's a basic

1038
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,240
example so but I'm going to um show you

1039
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,240
what I did for our case so let's open up

1040
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,280
the task column so it's it's a pretty

1041
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,240
lengthy code but in

1042
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,880
general uh for the so I'm going to

1043
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
explain all of the uh functions and all

1044
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,559
of the code in here so I'm going to

1045
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,559
we're going to start from the task colon

1046
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,680
areay and uh so here we are going to uh

1047
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,960
to Define it as the task type um that we

1048
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,200
created so for each object uh for each

1049
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,160
object is each column so this is the

1050
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,440
first column so we're going to use for

1051
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,559
the header so the header property is

1052
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,960
this uh part so we're GNA use the

1053
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,240
uh checkbox and the name of the header

1054
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,400
so this is what we're doing so we're

1055
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,880
using the

1056
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,280
checkbox and uh here we're going to use

1057
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,760
the um the checkbox to be able to so

1058
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,720
we're going to use the table uh

1059
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,240
parameter from this object to be able to

1060
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,720
actually select all of these elements

1061
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,280
when we click on so to be able to do

1062
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,640
this so this it's going to be so when we

1063
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,000
click on the

1064
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,359
so this is going to be triggered and

1065
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,559
this function or built-in function is

1066
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,960
going to be triggered to be able to

1067
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,400
select all of these all of the rows and

1068
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,559
uh here so we're having the cell

1069
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,520
function which going which represents

1070
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,040
each uh cell so here we're having the

1071
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,000
task um colon sorry I I I uh I said that

1072
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,720
this is part of the um of the checkbox

1073
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,359
column but it's it's another column

1074
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:05,440
which is this object and the next we're

1075
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,079
having the is

1076
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,480
favorite uh so uh the header it's going

1077
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,000
to be empty and we are going to only use

1078
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,760
the sell

1079
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,040
function and uh here we're going to

1080
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,559
access to each row and we're going to

1081
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,680
extract the icon by uh using the row

1082
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,359
that original that is favorite so if it

1083
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,280
is true then we're going to use the star

1084
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,119
icon and then we're going to return so

1085
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,799
if this because it might be uh undefined

1086
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:35,760
so if this not undefined then we're

1087
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,240
going to use the icon with the size 14

1088
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,200
and this is basically what we're having

1089
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,799
says the row or the is favorite property

1090
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:49,400
row has uh is true and we're having the

1091
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
title so for the header we're going to

1092
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,480
call the sortable header so uh here as

1093
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,000
you can see all of these colons are uh

1094
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,880
are going to have uh the actual drop

1095
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,960
down to be able to sort it and to avoid

1096
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,720
duplication the code as you can see

1097
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,559
we're going to call the same component

1098
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,760
called the sortable header which is

1099
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,039
going

1100
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:15,920
to have uh two uh Properties or two

1101
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,280
props the colon which is coming from the

1102
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,880
function and the label so and the same

1103
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,039
thing that I'm doing for the states the

1104
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:25,480
same thing that I'm doing for the

1105
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,880
priority but if we go to the searchable

1106
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,760
header so this is the actual code as you

1107
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,440
can see so here where you you're turning

1108
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,359
the drop down so if we click here as you

1109
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,240
can see we're having the drop down with

1110
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,520
the three element sentence sentence and

1111
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,119
the height element at the

1112
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,480
bottom so we're going to start from the

1113
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,559
top as I said this is accepting the

1114
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,520
colon and the label and this is the

1115
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,960
definition of the prompt so the colon

1116
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,839
it's going to be of this type and the

1117
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,480
label it's going to be of type string so

1118
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,160
first we're going to make sure that if

1119
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,640
this is sorted and here we're going to

1120
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,640
use the journey operators so if the is

1121
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,039
sorted is true we're going to use the

1122
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:11,200
ascendant uh uh if this is equal to

1123
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,039
ascendant we're going to use this icon

1124
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,079
otherwise else if the uh equal to

1125
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,440
descendant we're going to use this icon

1126
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,400
if uh the is sorted is not defined yet

1127
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,440
so we're going to use the arrow up and

1128
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,160
down um uh icon so the same thing that

1129
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,200
we're having here because it is not

1130
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,000
defined it so we're going to use this

1131
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
icon but as soon as I click on here as

1132
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,960
you can see this is going to be

1133
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,880
undefined and we're going to have the uh

1134
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,599
descended uh uh icon and the color is

1135
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,520
going to be changing just to tell the

1136
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,359
user which uh column that is currently

1137
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,839
sorted and finally we're going to use

1138
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:59,559
this hold go to be able to actually show

1139
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:04,240
or render the uh drop down so here we're

1140
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,640
going to add the uh the label here we

1141
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,960
are going to add the ascendant for each

1142
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,960
object so I should use a mob function so

1143
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,839
when I click on the ascendant item so

1144
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,920
here this is is going to be triggered so

1145
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,359
we're going to use the colum that tole

1146
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:25,039
sour chain so it's going to be true and

1147
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:27,280
uh for the send in it's going to be

1148
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,720
false and uh here we're having just the

1149
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,720
icon for the uh the item for the hide

1150
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,480
with it's icon so we're going to do some

1151
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,920
updates when we start making this fully

1152
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,359
uh functionable so uh let's continue

1153
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,480
with the other elements so we're having

1154
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,079
the title we're having the stages so for

1155
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:50,359
the

1156
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,039
stages first we're going to access to

1157
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:55,200
the states icon so we're having this

1158
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,720
function to be able to actually render

1159
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,280
each icon based on these stages so if it

1160
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,400
is equal to backlog we're going to use

1161
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,359
this icon if it it is equal to cancel

1162
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:08,960
we're going to use for this icon and the

1163
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,200
same for the other statuses and here for

1164
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,359
the priority icon we're doing the same

1165
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,319
thing so we're using the switch case to

1166
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,039
actually return the icon based on the

1167
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,319
priority so because we're going to reuse

1168
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,240
these functions

1169
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,119
and uh so this is how we are going to

1170
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,359
use them for the stages so we're going

1171
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,839
to use this function and depending on

1172
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:35,160
the stages that is coming from the row

1173
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,280
it's going to return the appropriate

1174
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,520
icon and we're going to save it inside

1175
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,079
the status constant and we're going to

1176
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,079
make sure since this is good be

1177
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,640
undefined or null so we're going to make

1178
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,079
sure that is not and then we're going to

1179
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,520
actually use whatever the icon that

1180
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,319
we're having in here and uh we're gonna

1181
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:01,559
just return the uh stages inside the uh

1182
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:05,760
span and uh so if we click on

1183
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,119
here so we're going to show the stages

1184
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,480
along with the icon which is this span

1185
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,359
so the same thing that we did for the

1186
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,400
priority just to save some time and for

1187
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,799
the created ad so we're going to extract

1188
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:22,039
the date of creation and we're going to

1189
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,440
use the format date to be able to

1190
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,799
actually format it like

1191
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:31,599
this and the format dat it's going to be

1192
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,720
uh this function so this is the function

1193
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,599
that we're going to use to be able to

1194
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,839
format date like this and finally we're

1195
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,880
having this part to be able to show the

1196
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,680
drop down for each task that we are

1197
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,760
going to build so this is basically our

1198
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,160
task uh table uh so the next thing that

1199
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,039
we're going to be adding is the

1200
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:56,520
pagination and as you can see the bottom

1201
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,039
of the desk area we're having the

1202
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,400
pagination so we're having how many rows

1203
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,319
uh has been selected and uh we're having

1204
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,480
this uh select component to be able to

1205
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,520
select the elements uh how many rows

1206
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,599
that you want to uh see in the table and

1207
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,559
the navigation buttons to be able to go

1208
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,720
from one page to another so it is the

1209
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,960
same that we're having at the uh bottom

1210
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,720
so the first thing that we should be

1211
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,400
doing we should be uh installing the

1212
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,520
select component by copying this and

1213
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,160
paste it in your terminal on hden enter

1214
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,839
so you should have in the components

1215
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,440
folder so the select. GSX so this is

1216
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,720
what we're going to use for this uh for

1217
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:53,079
this uh part so uh now let's go to the

1218
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,279
task area so I created a new folder

1219
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,960
called the task pagination or the

1220
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,799
pagination folder so we're having the

1221
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,960
page pagination area so let me delete

1222
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,559
all of this so this is the actual code

1223
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:10,720
so we're having the printi so here we're

1224
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,880
having the span tag to be able to show

1225
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,520
how many rows has been selected and here

1226
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,039
we're having so because this uh parent

1227
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,839
St is separated into two components to

1228
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,240
make sure that uh these elements are

1229
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,559
going to be LED uh at uh the extremities

1230
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,760
of each of the TBL so that's why we

1231
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,680
added like them and we added the justify

1232
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,279
between and the item Center to be

1233
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:42,720
centered uh so so so that they can to be

1234
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,480
uh centered uh

1235
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,079
vertically so here we're having the pat

1236
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,119
ination selection which is another

1237
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,240
component so instead of just adding the

1238
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,319
component in this uh soorry I created

1239
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,200
another component called pation

1240
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,200
selection and I imported it from here as

1241
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,039
the pation selection component and then

1242
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:07,359
we're having inside this div all of the

1243
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,920
navigation buttons so as you can see

1244
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,160
here I'm just commenting this uh when we

1245
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,240
start working on the table and making it

1246
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,319
working so we're going to use it uh the

1247
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,880
table um the table uh object so we're

1248
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,960
going to add it as a prompt so so just

1249
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,119
uh to not lose this code so I'm just

1250
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,200
commenting this out so when I start

1251
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,839
working on this I'm going to comment out

1252
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:37,039
all of these and it's going to work uh

1253
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,039
so it so the navigation are going to be

1254
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:42,640
working so for each button so we're

1255
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,319
having four button and this is what

1256
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,079
we're having so this is for the first

1257
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,440
button the second button the third third

1258
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,359
and the final

1259
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,319
Buon and finally we're having the pation

1260
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,359
selection which is a very simple

1261
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,839
component for this

1262
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:03,799
part so you can look at this how it is

1263
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,839
working into the

1264
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:11,079
Shaden uh into the Shaden uh or into the

1265
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,520
page in the Shan website so uh what I

1266
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,079
did just copy this and I just tweak

1267
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:19,160
things so here we're using the mob

1268
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,799
function to be able to actually see the

1269
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:23,880
numbers like this so instead of

1270
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,480
hardcoding each element

1271
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,599
and finally we need to go to the task

1272
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,599
area. GSX add the fer and we're going to

1273
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,520
add the pattion area so one last thing

1274
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,000
for the table that we're going to need

1275
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,520
to add is uh the actual drop down for

1276
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,640
each task so whenever click on this so

1277
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,799
if we go to the

1278
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,119
tasks uh to the tasks uh component and

1279
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,720
when you click on here so we're going to

1280
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,319
have this dro down so this is what we

1281
01:04:57,319 --> 01:05:02,000
are going to be uh adding inside our uh

1282
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,359
project so the final thing in the table

1283
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,200
that we're going to be adding is the

1284
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
drop down so right now as you can see

1285
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,279
we're having the three dots uh column um

1286
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:16,359
or icon so when I click on it so we're

1287
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:19,440
going to have this beautiful uh drop

1288
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,880
down uh so it is the same drop down that

1289
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,760
I used in here so the only thing that I

1290
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,559
added is the icons so uh when I hover

1291
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,440
over the label so we're going to have

1292
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,920
plug feature documentation so we're

1293
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,720
going to make this work but also I added

1294
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,319
some color into the

1295
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:45,920
delete uh group or the delete item so

1296
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,200
let's go back to the vs code so uh first

1297
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,839
the drop down it's going to be a

1298
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:53,440
combination of two elements so we're

1299
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,160
having this and also we're going to have

1300
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,799
another drop down uh kind of for the

1301
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,000
label so I'm going to show you how to do

1302
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,920
this so here I created the task dropdown

1303
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,799
folder so as you can see just to make

1304
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,920
things uh organized so we're going to

1305
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,119
actually instead of putting all the code

1306
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,839
in one place so we are going uh we are

1307
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:22,720
going to divide it into uh multiple uh

1308
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,680
files so first we're having the constant

1309
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,000
.ts so here we are going to uh add the

1310
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,559
constants so this is the menu items so

1311
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,799
uh here we're having all the objects uh

1312
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,000
the edit the make copy and the favorite

1313
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,119
and this it's going for the uh where so

1314
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:47,559
this area is going to to be for the uh

1315
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:50,440
label uh just for organiz and purposes

1316
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,319
so we're going to store all of these

1317
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,400
areas in one file so then we're having

1318
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,960
the menu items the sub label menu and

1319
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,160
the task dropdown so let's start first

1320
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,440
from the task dropdown so here we're

1321
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,520
having all of the elements uh that we

1322
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,920
need to import to make this functional

1323
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,680
component

1324
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,200
work so here we're uh uh we're adding

1325
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,920
the select label states where we're uh

1326
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,240
whenever we click on the uh on the item

1327
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,760
we need to store uh whatever that you

1328
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,720
are clicking in to be able to use it

1329
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,559
later on so this is the code of the drop

1330
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,960
down so we're having the structure uh

1331
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,480
the Shad CN structure so the drop- down

1332
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,520
menu and the drop- down menu trigger the

1333
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,200
button so here we're just adding the

1334
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,799
three dots icon from I think from react

1335
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:47,400
tons so let me see so this is for from

1336
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,319
the react tons and then for the drop-

1337
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:53,440
down menu content so we're going to use

1338
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,119
the drop down menu group where we're

1339
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,119
going to actually use the menu items

1340
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,760
area that I showed you and iterate

1341
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,319
through each object and you for each

1342
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,720
object uh from the uh menu items area

1343
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,279
we're going to pass or to uh pass the

1344
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:14,920
item inside the menu item component uh

1345
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,000
that I'm going to show you and then

1346
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
we're having the separator which is this

1347
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,560
one so all of these uh uh items are in

1348
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,799
one group so we're having

1349
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:32,000
the separator then we're having the um

1350
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,880
we're having the um the label Sub menu

1351
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,440
which is for the label so I'm going to

1352
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,040
show you how this is working and finally

1353
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,080
we're going to reuse the menu item

1354
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,719
functional component to be able to

1355
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,759
actually uh render the uh Delete uh

1356
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,199
item uh so as you can see it is a

1357
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:57,080
combination of sub sub uh or child

1358
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,480
components so just for organ

1359
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,759
organization purposes so I made it like

1360
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,759
this so uh the first thing so you don't

1361
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:10,719
have to create this from uh from the

1362
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,920
start uh so first you need to create the

1363
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,319
whole component and then shop it down

1364
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,719
into sub functional component so this is

1365
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:23,239
what I did uh so let's go first to the

1366
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,719
menu item so this is the menu item as

1367
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:29,400
you can see so uh it's going to accept

1368
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,480
the icon the label the shortcut and the

1369
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,759
class name so this is what we are doing

1370
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:37,080
into the main functional component so we

1371
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,839
are going to pass inside of the menu

1372
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,080
item functional component all of these

1373
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,520
elements so you can be able to use them

1374
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,199
inside this menu item and this is

1375
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,159
responsible for rendering each element

1376
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:51,719
that we're having so we're having the

1377
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,640
icon the actual label and also the

1378
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,880
shortcut

1379
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,080
and also I added this class name uh just

1380
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,480
uh as an optional uh because we're going

1381
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,080
to reuse this into the delete item so to

1382
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,120
be able to actually change the uh red

1383
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,640
color so that's why I added the class

1384
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,080
name as optional into the promp and this

1385
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,159
is basically the drop down menu items so

1386
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,920
we're having the icon the label the

1387
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,520
shortcut so want to make sure that this

1388
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,400
is uh not undefined whatsoever so then

1389
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,400
we can be able to use safely this drop

1390
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,560
down menu shortcut uh element from Shad

1391
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,159
CN so next I'm going to show you the sub

1392
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:42,400
label menu. TSX so it's going to have

1393
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,440
the value and the on value change so

1394
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,960
we're going to add this as a call back

1395
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,600
function so whenever we click on here so

1396
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,520
this is going to trigger the on value uh

1397
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,400
uh callback function that we're going to

1398
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,520
use it inside the actual uh parent

1399
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,199
component of it uh to be able to update

1400
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,880
uh the states so we're going to work on

1401
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
this but now I want to show you just

1402
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,400
structure of the functional component

1403
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,560
and uh so this is the structure so we're

1404
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,159
having the drop- down menu sub and uh

1405
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,960
here we're having the uh the icon the

1406
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,840
label and uh here we are going to add

1407
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,520
the or to use the label options area to

1408
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:33,000
map to each element and use the uh drop-

1409
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,440
down menu radio item so one thing that I

1410
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,400
didn't show you so here when I click so

1411
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,239
we're going to have the drop down or the

1412
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,960
radio group here so whenever we are

1413
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,760
clicking on the element so this is

1414
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,239
basically how we can be able to create

1415
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,239
the uh actual uh dropdown for each uh

1416
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:58,719
task so so after we created the UI uh of

1417
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,239
the uh main page of the application the

1418
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:03,320
next element that I added is the

1419
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,320
dialogue to be able to add the new task

1420
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,320
so when I click on the button so we're

1421
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,080
going to have this wonderful dialogue

1422
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,239
and we're going to use Shad to be able

1423
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,600
to build this very quickly so we're

1424
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,080
going to have the title we're going to

1425
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,920
have the status so it's a drop down to

1426
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,960
be able to change the status the task

1427
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,560
priority and the task label so we're

1428
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,880
going to stock we're going to stick with

1429
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,199
these labels as uh so since we are going

1430
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,920
to work uh or being inspired from the

1431
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,760
task component and the Shad CN and

1432
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,440
finally we're having the close and add

1433
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,000
new uh task uh button so let's go back

1434
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,639
to the vs code to show you how I created

1435
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:47,760
all of

1436
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,920
this so the first thing uh so I'm going

1437
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,679
to show you the structure of the files

1438
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,480
so I created the new folder called task

1439
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,080
dialogue and we're going to have the

1440
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,920
main file I just called it uh uh task

1441
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,080
dialogue and here we're having the subc

1442
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,679
components for each element we're going

1443
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:10,600
to put it in its own file so let's start

1444
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,080
by the actual uh file so we're having

1445
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,560
all the Imports needed so we're having

1446
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,639
the dialogue uh the components uh that

1447
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,639
we're going to use from the dialogue uh

1448
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:26,560
component uh which uh we're going to use

1449
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,719
uh uh in the uh following structure and

1450
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,639
here we're having the separator the

1451
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:34,880
button and we're importing all the

1452
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,120
components inside the sub components

1453
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,440
folder for each element so first we're

1454
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,360
having the trigger button so it is a

1455
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,800
button and then we're having the dialog

1456
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,280
content so inside the dialog content

1457
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,159
we're having the header so the title and

1458
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,239
the description so we're having a

1459
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:56,239
separator to be able to create this

1460
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:00,360
separator at the top and then after this

1461
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,320
we're going to create a div and inside

1462
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,199
this div we're going to create all the

1463
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:09,760
or uh add all the components so uh here

1464
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,679
we are creating another div just to make

1465
01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:14,639
sure that these two elements are going

1466
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:19,000
to be uh positioned in a grid position

1467
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,080
and the same thing that we did for the

1468
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,040
remaining Elements which are the task

1469
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,239
priority and the task label so and

1470
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,440
finally we're having in the future the

1471
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,880
close button so it is a built in

1472
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,560
component dialogue close so uh

1473
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,800
eventually it's going to uh close the

1474
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,719
dialogue uh automatically when I C click

1475
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:42,400
on the close button and finally we're

1476
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,840
having the add new task button so we

1477
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,520
added it as a type submit since we're

1478
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,679
going to WRA everything uh within a for

1479
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,159
check so when we start working with the

1480
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,840
react hook form library to be able to

1481
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,960
track all the inputs and the fields that

1482
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,000
we're having inside the dialogue so now

1483
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,199
let's go to the sub components I'm going

1484
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,920
to start by the easiest one which is the

1485
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,560
task title so the task title so it has

1486
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,600
so all of the components here have the

1487
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,480
label so it has the label it has also

1488
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,360
the input and also the error message so

1489
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,880
this is what we're having uh we are

1490
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,880
returning as a GS six so we're having

1491
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,800
the label with these utility classes the

1492
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,360
input and also the ptag so here we are

1493
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,239
going to add the actual error so now

1494
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:40,120
let's go to the second component which

1495
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,719
is the drop down the task stages so this

1496
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:46,600
is the file that is responsible for this

1497
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,120
so here we are importing these icons we

1498
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:54,639
important the task uh the task uh type

1499
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:57,000
since we're going to use it so I'm going

1500
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,880
to show you why we did so and also we're

1501
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,120
using these component these select

1502
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,480
components to make to have this uh drop

1503
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,600
down so here we are going to create our

1504
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,280
areay called statuses and this is the

1505
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,679
top for each object the value and icon

1506
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,679
so here we are going to extract all the

1507
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,560
uh necessary uh uh literal types that we

1508
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,320
created so if we go to the file so the

1509
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,360
status it has all the literal types with

1510
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,840
the Union types so to be able to extract

1511
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,280
this so without having to uh use or

1512
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,560
reuse the states we can be able to add

1513
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,280
it just like this so we're going to take

1514
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,480
it from the task type and we're going to

1515
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,480
add the actual property within the uh

1516
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,480
within the brackets and then we can be

1517
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,880
able to access to all the literal tpes

1518
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,360
that we created in inside the

1519
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,360
stages so when for example just to show

1520
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,719
you what we did so so when I did this so

1521
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,040
it's going to uh actually give me only

1522
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,679
the uh actual uh types that we added

1523
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,840
inside the states so this is why we

1524
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,600
Define it like this just for type safety

1525
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,800
so for each value it has its own icon so

1526
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,800
that's why we added the icons at the top

1527
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,719
and here we are going to inside the

1528
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,360
functional component so we're going to

1529
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,560
create

1530
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,960
uh a state where we uh save uh the

1531
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,320
stages that we clicked on and it's going

1532
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,440
to we going to assert the typ so the

1533
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,520
same thing that we are that uh we did uh

1534
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,880
that I explain so here it's going to

1535
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,800
give me again the types uh so and also

1536
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,199
it's going to make the coding experience

1537
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,760
a lot easier and also uh you will not

1538
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,600
run into uh into problems and bugs later

1539
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,639
on when you want to run the application

1540
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:58,400
so that's the power of

1541
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,679
typescript so here we're having the

1542
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:03,320
label and here we're having the select

1543
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,520
component so here we're having uh the

1544
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,000
value property and the on value chain so

1545
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,719
whenever I click on uh one of the items

1546
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,239
as I'm going to show you so the on value

1547
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:18,400
change it's going to be triggered so we

1548
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,199
are going to set the value parameter as

1549
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,800
of type status and then we're going to

1550
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,400
update these selected status with the

1551
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,360
value that we changed with and then

1552
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,679
we're having the trigger so which is the

1553
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,280
selected value and then we're having the

1554
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,760
content and uh so we're going to map

1555
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,920
through each status inside the object in

1556
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,360
within the select group so we can be

1557
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,000
able to render each element so here the

1558
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,120
value it's going to be the status. value

1559
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,719
so the status is coming from the mob

1560
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,560
function so we're having the status.

1561
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,960
icon and also the status. uh value and

1562
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,199
also we're add in some utility classes

1563
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:06,239
to style our item so this is basically

1564
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,000
how we created the status so it is a

1565
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,199
very easy uh thing to create and also

1566
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,679
the checkbox it's going to be handled

1567
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,000
for the for us by the Shad CN logic so

1568
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,560
now we're going to go to the task

1569
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,400
priority so it's going to be pretty much

1570
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,560
the same logic so let me close this I'm

1571
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,480
going to save the file and then I'm

1572
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,880
going to go to the task priority so as

1573
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,679
you can see we are going to follow the

1574
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,520
same structure so the only thing that is

1575
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,880
going to be different is the priority so

1576
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,120
uh and also the uh objects so we're

1577
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,840
going to have just low medium and high

1578
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,080
and uh as you can see the code uh

1579
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,199
follows the same structure so the naming

1580
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,920
it's going to be different a bit and

1581
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,040
also as I said the prop so we're going

1582
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,120
to use the

1583
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,320
property uh the the priority uh type

1584
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,600
instead of using the stages and uh for

1585
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,520
the remaining code it is pretty much the

1586
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:15,800
same and also for the task or the uh

1587
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,880
tasks label so as you can see it's going

1588
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,679
to be uh the same so the only thing that

1589
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,760
is different is so here we're going to

1590
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,920
xess the label property and uh for the

1591
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,719
remaining code as I explained so it's

1592
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,760
going to be uh it's going to be pretty

1593
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,199
much uh the same so this is how we can

1594
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,400
be able to create our dialogue so once

1595
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,080
now we create the UI of of our whole

1596
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,159
application so we're going to start

1597
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:49,520
making this application uh

1598
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,480
functionable so the next feature that we

1599
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,560
are going to add is the uh search of the

1600
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,679
tasks so here as you can see when I type

1601
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:05,120
in um stuff so uh we're going to have

1602
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,440
live search as you can see so because

1603
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,800
I'm typing fix so I'm going to have the

1604
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,480
title or the task uh that includes the

1605
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,760
fix word and if something that has not

1606
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,159
been found I'm going to have this uh

1607
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:24,040
simple error so uh and also we're going

1608
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:29,120
to use uh tack react table so um let's

1609
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,280
go back to the vsod then the first

1610
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,440
component or library that we're going to

1611
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,600
be adding for State Management is

1612
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,719
npm install zustan so we're going to use

1613
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:43,400
zustan for State Management so uh so

1614
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,239
we're going to use it for uh the query

1615
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,400
since uh this part and another component

1616
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,440
and this part is another component so uh

1617
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,840
to be able to avoid using prop drilling

1618
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,719
so we're going to use the state CH

1619
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,239
management to be able so whenever we are

1620
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:03,040
typing we're going to

1621
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,679
save uh the character that we are typing

1622
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,560
in a a qu in a state called query and

1623
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,080
this stage is going to be used inside

1624
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,560
the uh the uh task area where we are

1625
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,120
using the react table to be able to

1626
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,239
access to the query and actually do the

1627
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:21,920
filtering so first I created a new

1628
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,000
folder called called hooks so this is

1629
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,120
the use quare store and this is how we

1630
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,080
can be able to create uh a context and

1631
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,880
then the uh in zustan that is called uh

1632
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,280
store so first

1633
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,719
we B the create uh element from the Zas

1634
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:44,760
chent library and then this is how we're

1635
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,159
going to create our store so I call it

1636
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:49,639
use Query store so we're going to use

1637
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:53,120
the create element and uh so here we are

1638
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,400
going to define the structure

1639
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,960
of uh the our store how it's going to uh

1640
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,360
be so we're having just two elements

1641
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,760
query and the set query and this is the

1642
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,040
signature of the function and this is

1643
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,719
the type of the query so it's going to

1644
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:10,960
be string and the function is going to

1645
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,639
accept a parameter which is query of

1646
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:16,280
type string and it's not going to return

1647
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,239
nothing meaning that's going to be a

1648
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,560
simple function so the query so we're

1649
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,040
going to set the default Valu so the

1650
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,639
query is to be empty and the set query

1651
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,199
is going to update the query which is

1652
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:34,040
this one by using the set method which

1653
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,960
is in uh uh provided by zent so this is

1654
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,960
a very simple store to create with zent

1655
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,719
so the uh next thing that I did I

1656
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:50,199
created this function so this basically

1657
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,600
this function is going to be linked to

1658
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,320
the use react table

1659
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,400
so uh so you will understand why we did

1660
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,679
this function but uh the functions uh in

1661
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:05,679
the uh react query so the filter

1662
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,719
functions will uh accept uh three

1663
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:12,199
arguments by default so we're going to

1664
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:14,960
just use the row and the filter value so

1665
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,719
we're going to access to the title by

1666
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,360
using the row. get value and here make

1667
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,280
sure to add the actual uh key that we

1668
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,880
added in

1669
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,239
the task column. GSX so so it has to be

1670
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:32,199
the same key that we used so we're going

1671
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:34,480
to because we're going to search by the

1672
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,880
title so that's why I added the title

1673
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,199
and the query so the query it's going to

1674
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:44,360
be taken from the filter value so we are

1675
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:48,560
going to uh convert it to string and

1676
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,320
then it's going to be a lowercase and

1677
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,320
we're going to return this whatever that

1678
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,520
we're having in this manner so this

1679
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,119
title function it's going to be used

1680
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:01,880
inside the use react table so if we go

1681
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,440
to the task area and uh if we go to the

1682
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,840
tasks table so basically we're going to

1683
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,880
be adding some of the elements here

1684
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,600
inside the use react table so we're

1685
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,920
going to be adding the colon filters so

1686
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,639
these states and also we're going to add

1687
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:22,159
the G filter row model I think this

1688
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,800
function is going to handle the

1689
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,360
filtering

1690
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,159
and the on col colon filter change so

1691
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,679
it's going to be linked to the set colon

1692
01:25:30,679 --> 01:25:33,119
filters and the state so make sure to

1693
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:35,840
add the state object and inside of it

1694
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,960
we're going to be adding the colon

1695
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,679
filters so uh the actual filter so the

1696
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,679
most advanced and the challenging part

1697
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:47,080
in the react query table is the

1698
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,040
filtering and unfortunately they're not

1699
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,239
providing a very well uh organized and

1700
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:55,719
very simple to use documentation so it

1701
01:25:55,719 --> 01:25:57,320
took me a while to be able to understand

1702
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,400
and the way how they are engineering

1703
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,159
this it's a little bit uh hard advance

1704
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,800
and it's going to be overwhelmed for

1705
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,040
many of uh people who just getting

1706
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:11,800
started with this especially uh it it it

1707
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,239
uses typescript heavily so it's going to

1708
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,000
add uh a layer of

1709
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,480
complexity so here we're going to add

1710
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,960
the filter function property and we are

1711
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,440
going to add the title fil filter so

1712
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,320
this title filter so this is the

1713
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,280
function that we're going to be

1714
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:35,360
adding um in the filter functions so if

1715
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,480
we go at the top as you can see we're

1716
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,480
going to uh import it from the from this

1717
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,880
file and also we need to add this

1718
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,520
interface this title filter interface in

1719
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,360
this in the

1720
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,159
uh uh module so this is very

1721
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,920
important to add

1722
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:59,199
this and uh basically so I think that I

1723
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,159
explained everything in here and finally

1724
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,639
we're going to have this use effect hook

1725
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,840
and it's going to be dependent upon the

1726
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,520
query so the query it's going to be used

1727
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,239
from the use Query store uh that I

1728
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,920
showed you so here we're going to create

1729
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,600
the new filters of type colon filter

1730
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,920
State and just to show you how this

1731
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,119
colon filter looks like in the console

1732
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:25,159
log so let's me console log there

1733
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:27,520
and I'm going to save the file so let's

1734
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,880
open up the console

1735
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,760
log so I'm going to access to the

1736
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,320
console log Let's uh let's uh clear this

1737
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,239
so when I typ uh when I type uh

1738
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:42,480
something in here so this is the area so

1739
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,440
this is the colum filter area so it is a

1740
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,840
very simple object the title and the

1741
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,440
value of the query so this is what we

1742
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,920
are doing in the use effect so only if

1743
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,719
the query is is changing we're going to

1744
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:00,800
push uh the the object with the new

1745
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,920
value of the query and then we're going

1746
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,000
to update the SE colon filter so the

1747
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,040
reason why they are doing it like this

1748
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,520
uh like an area because as we will see

1749
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,760
we are going to add two more filters the

1750
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,440
stages and the priority so when we're

1751
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,840
going to add the status we're going to

1752
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,199
have another object with the ID called

1753
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:26,040
uh status and the value it's going to be

1754
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,040
uh these values that we are uh checking

1755
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,320
in here while we're going to start

1756
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,480
working with the status so once you

1757
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,000
understand how this is working so you

1758
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,320
can add pretty much any filter that you

1759
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,320
want so it's going to follow the same

1760
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,600
principles so let me delete this console

1761
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,920
log and this is basically how we can be

1762
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,360
able to create our first uh filter and

1763
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,880
finally so this is something obvious we

1764
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,920
need need to link the query and the set

1765
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,800
query with the input so the value it's

1766
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
going to be linked to the query and the

1767
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,600
set query it's going to be link to the

1768
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,119
onchange V listener of the input so when

1769
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:09,239
this is changing so whenever we are

1770
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:12,159
changing uh anything in the input so

1771
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:15,040
it's going to uh change the query and

1772
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:20,159
the set query and uh and uh by that it's

1773
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,920
going to handle and actually execute all

1774
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,719
the filtering inside this use react uh

1775
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,639
table so next I added the priority

1776
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,320
filter so uh here as you can see when I

1777
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,639
click on low so I'm going to only show

1778
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:40,920
the task that has the priority as low so

1779
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,040
right now I want to just show the tasks

1780
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,440
that have low and medium so I can click

1781
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,840
on this as you can see we're having only

1782
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,840
two task because they um they uh they

1783
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,400
have the medium and the low priority and

1784
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,040
also also we're going to be adding uh

1785
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,600
the numbers to calculate automatically

1786
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,000
how many uh tasks that are referring to

1787
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,320
each

1788
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,480
priority and uh when I click on reset so

1789
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,639
actually the filter it's going to uh so

1790
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,119
the filter it's going to end and also we

1791
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,840
can be able to actually show only the

1792
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,119
TXS or the filter and the tags like this

1793
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:28,400
uh so as you can see everything is

1794
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,440
working fine and also uh along with that

1795
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,560
we can be able to uh as this filter is

1796
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,600
working we can actually filter uh even

1797
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,840
further by the

1798
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,360
title

1799
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,440
so let's go back to the vs code so the

1800
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,199
first thing that I did I created a new a

1801
01:30:50,199 --> 01:30:54,199
new store so it's going to uh so for

1802
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,400
this store we are going to actually

1803
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,080
store the uh priorities that we are

1804
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,360
checking and also we're going to use its

1805
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,560
own seter so this is basically the store

1806
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,400
so this is the interface so the check

1807
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,239
priorities it's going to be of type

1808
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,800
priority and the set check priority it's

1809
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,480
going to be this signature it's going to

1810
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,639
accept the priorities as a parameter of

1811
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,080
type priorities as an array and inside

1812
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,480
the store so the check priority it's

1813
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,800
going to be an empty area first and then

1814
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,239
this is how we're going to update our

1815
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:31,679
checked priorities by using the set

1816
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:36,639
method from actual uh zent so then I'm

1817
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,440
going to show you how to be able to link

1818
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,199
this with the priority drop down so the

1819
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,920
priority drop down I did so many things

1820
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,600
to be able to change the drop down so

1821
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,040
the first thing that I did I got read

1822
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:56,280
from the select priority so instead

1823
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,719
we're going to use the checked

1824
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:01,760
priorities which is the uh status that I

1825
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,760
just show you inside the new

1826
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,119
store and here we're having the open and

1827
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:10,199
the set open so these values or these

1828
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,920
states we're going to use them here at

1829
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,880
the bottom of the pop over so now I'm

1830
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,040
going to show you all the functions that

1831
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,520
we're having in here so as you can see I

1832
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,960
added some comment to not get lost and

1833
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,360
also to know each function that is doing

1834
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,480
so we're having the first function which

1835
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,040
is the update D selection so this is

1836
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,719
going to update the array whenever we

1837
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,760
check an element so if we go to the GSX

1838
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,280
we're going to start from uh the uh GSX

1839
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:51,040
and the here so this function it's going

1840
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,520
to be linked to the ons select event

1841
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,760
list so whenever we select on the

1842
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,080
command item so this is going to be

1843
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,199
triggered and we're going to pass inside

1844
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,280
of it the priority.

1845
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,280
label so if we go all the way up into

1846
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,400
the function so this is the label it's

1847
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:13,199
going to be of type string so first uh

1848
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,520
what we're going to do here some we're

1849
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,000
going to do some uh typescript stuff so

1850
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,239
uh because the label is a string so it

1851
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:26,679
need to be casted as a priority but to

1852
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,360
make sure that this casting is valid so

1853
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,280
uh and to not run to any

1854
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,920
troubles first we are going to create an

1855
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,760
array of the valid priorities by uh

1856
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,480
using the priority uh type so those are

1857
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,159
only values that we're going to be using

1858
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,440
and here we are going to check if the

1859
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,639
label is part of the priority

1860
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,360
so if it is uh not yet we are going to

1861
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:01,040
exit the function and then we are going

1862
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,480
to return this console log so uh these

1863
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,800
are just top script stuff so it may add

1864
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,960
a little bit of complexity to your code

1865
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,719
but when you start working with top

1866
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,600
script we will know why this is very

1867
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,600
very

1868
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,480
handful um and then we can be able to

1869
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,440
safely cast the label as priority so the

1870
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,840
first first thing that we are going to

1871
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,239
do we are going to check if the element

1872
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:32,199
that we checked or um so if we click on

1873
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:35,280
low for example so we want to check if

1874
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,520
this is include in the uh checked

1875
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,080
priorities so uh if it is we are going

1876
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,920
to delete it by using the filter method

1877
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,159
otherwise we are going to be added and

1878
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:52,480
here we're going to add this uh this uh

1879
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,600
syntax which means that we are going to

1880
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,679
just keep all the previous elements and

1881
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,400
then we're going to add the priority

1882
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,239
next to all of the other elements then

1883
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:07,560
we're going to update the checked

1884
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,239
properities by using the set checked

1885
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:14,199
priorities so uh this is the function to

1886
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:17,679
be able to add or delete uh so I'm going

1887
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,119
to console log this just to show what

1888
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,600
happens whenever we are I click

1889
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,159
on the priorities so let me open up the

1890
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:31,000
console log so when I click on low as

1891
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,480
you can see I'm going to have an

1892
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,199
array uh the low and the array so the

1893
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:37,960
same thing if I click on medium so when

1894
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,760
I click on medium again so it's going to

1895
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,679
be deleted so this function is going to

1896
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:45,719
handle this for

1897
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:50,280
us so uh and uh this function uh we are

1898
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:54,760
going to um count how many any tasks

1899
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,679
that have the priority so here we're

1900
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,840
using the use memo hook just for uh for

1901
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,080
optimization so you don't you don't have

1902
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,679
to do this because we're not going to

1903
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:08,199
have a lot of data but just to know how

1904
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:11,920
the use memo hook works so the first

1905
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,119
thing that we're going to do we're going

1906
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:16,040
to make sure that the tasks is if it is

1907
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,080
empty or if it is null so then we're

1908
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,400
going to actually just return the

1909
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,080
priorities uh

1910
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,320
area and uh then we're going to do our

1911
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,400
counting so the counting is very simple

1912
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,639
so we are going to filter uh the tasks

1913
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:37,320
by their priority uh so this is for the

1914
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,800
count by low so we're going to do this

1915
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,639
and to be able to access to the number

1916
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:43,760
we're going to use the length so we're

1917
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,199
doing the same thing for the medium for

1918
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:51,639
the uh high and then we are going to

1919
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:56,239
return the uh actual values by using the

1920
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,800
pro uh the priorities area. mop function

1921
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,400
to be able to access to each element and

1922
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,800
then we're going to use the switch

1923
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,199
method so we're going to access to the

1924
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:11,560
value of each property so if this is uh

1925
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,719
low so we're going to turn the uh so

1926
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,800
we're going to change the count property

1927
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,440
by the state or the variable which is

1928
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,800
the count by low so the same thing for

1929
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,000
medium and the the same thing for the uh

1930
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,480
for the high so this is going to be

1931
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:32,199
dependent upon the uh task so the use

1932
01:37:32,199 --> 01:37:34,840
memo hook it's going it works like

1933
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:37,119
pretty much the same like the use effect

1934
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,760
hook but the difference here it's going

1935
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,320
to return a value so then we can be able

1936
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,719
to use this priority hook and if we go

1937
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:50,960
at the bottom in the

1938
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,400
um in the uh GSX so we can be able to

1939
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:59,599
use it and actually uh access to the

1940
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:03,239
count State because we added it in we

1941
01:38:03,239 --> 01:38:08,159
updated inside this use memo hook so

1942
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,080
this is basically how we can be able to

1943
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,080
update this and also inside the check

1944
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,119
box so the check that's going to be

1945
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,639
dependent if the priority that label is

1946
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,960
included inside the checked properties

1947
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,000
so since the checked uh is a

1948
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,199
ban meaning true or false so this if

1949
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,440
this is true so that it's going to be

1950
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,040
checked otherwise it's going to be and

1951
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,719
checked so this is basically how we can

1952
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:39,159
be able to update uh the uh this drop

1953
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,400
down and finally I'm going to show you

1954
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,040
what how we can be able to just show the

1955
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,880
badges or the tags that we selected so

1956
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,960
here so this is the actual statement

1957
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,159
where to be able to do so so we're going

1958
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,920
to make sure that uh the checked

1959
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:00,560
properties length is more than zero so

1960
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,599
and then we are going to add the

1961
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:05,599
separator and then we're going to use

1962
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:07,719
the checked properties area to map

1963
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:09,800
through each element and we're going to

1964
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,199
use the badge uh functional component

1965
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,719
from Shad CN and we're going to use the

1966
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:19,599
checked property inside uh each object

1967
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:22,159
and the check priority so this is going

1968
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,239
to be uh a priority

1969
01:39:25,239 --> 01:39:28,080
type so I hope that I explained this so

1970
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,480
as you can see it is a PR lengthy code

1971
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,679
but uh you understand how this is

1972
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:35,199
working even though that it seems very

1973
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,320
easy to build but as you can see behind

1974
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,119
the scene uh there is a lot of code to

1975
01:39:40,119 --> 01:39:43,320
create this and finally when I click on

1976
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,960
the reset so it's going to be deleted so

1977
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,000
all you have to do go to the task area.

1978
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,520
GSX and here inside this button there is

1979
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,159
set button so I added this onclick event

1980
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:00,360
listener and all it has uh all it does

1981
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,920
is uh it update the checked priorities

1982
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,599
and an empty areay so we're going to use

1983
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:08,639
this from this store that we created

1984
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,400
inside the hooks uh folder so after we

1985
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,719
added the priority filter the next

1986
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,040
filter that I added is the states so

1987
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,560
when I click on the drop down and let's

1988
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,840
click on the to-do so as you can see our

1989
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:26,560
filter is working and now we are seeing

1990
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,920
the actual filter uh or the uh element

1991
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,960
that we filtered by so when you click on

1992
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,719
the progress so we're going to see both

1993
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,400
tasks uh that have the prog the in

1994
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,920
progress and the backlog and uh also

1995
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,080
when I click on the reset as you can see

1996
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,239
uh so the filters are going to be uh

1997
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:52,560
reset and also I added more task just to

1998
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:58,760
show that uh both priority and Status

1999
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,719
are working so when I click on the reset

2000
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:06,480
both are going to be reset reseted so

2001
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:11,040
let's go back to the vs code and uh so

2002
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,719
uh first I'm going to show you so we're

2003
01:41:13,719 --> 01:41:15,400
going to we're going to follow the same

2004
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,239
step that we did for the priority so

2005
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,920
meaning that first we need to create a

2006
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,560
new store by using zent where we're

2007
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:27,400
going to save the elements that we check

2008
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,040
so uh this is what we did so we created

2009
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,679
our interface so the check status is

2010
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,040
going to be of type status as an array

2011
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,040
and the set check status to be able to

2012
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,360
update this state and here we're going

2013
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,960
to use the create element from zustan to

2014
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,760
be able to actually create our store so

2015
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,440
the check state is going to be an empty

2016
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,480
area array

2017
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,520
uh uh by default and then we're going to

2018
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,840
use the set check status to be able to

2019
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,400
update this uh actual state so after we

2020
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,239
did this uh the next thing that I added

2021
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:11,280
is the filter function so I added this

2022
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,040
filter function that we're going to use

2023
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,239
inside the use react table so it is

2024
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,960
pretty much the same uh function that we

2025
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,760
did for the priority filter so the only

2026
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,480
thing that is going to be changing is

2027
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,360
the

2028
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:29,159
status um so after we created our filter

2029
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:32,159
so the next uh thing we're going to go

2030
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:35,719
to the uh task area and also we're going

2031
01:42:35,719 --> 01:42:39,280
to go to the uh task table so we're

2032
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,840
going to add some stuff in here so the

2033
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,880
first thing that we are going to do

2034
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,320
we're going to add the check status

2035
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,199
array uh because we're going to uh use

2036
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:52,239
it inside the use effect hook but also

2037
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,360
we're going to use these status filter

2038
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:57,360
the function that I just showed you and

2039
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,520
here inside the use effect hook so uh

2040
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,639
we're going to do the same thing that we

2041
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:04,440
did for the priorties so we're going to

2042
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,679
check if this checked stages. links is

2043
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,560
more than zero then we're going to add

2044
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,800
this object inside the new filters

2045
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,560
before we can update the colon filters

2046
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,199
so just to show you how uh this uh would

2047
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:27,520
look like so if we uh console log this

2048
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,520
so let's console log the new

2049
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,920
filters and I'm going to open up the

2050
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,080
console

2051
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,239
log so and I'm going to click on this so

2052
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:41,719
here as you can see uh we're going to

2053
01:43:41,719 --> 01:43:44,040
have our object and the value it's going

2054
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,480
to be an area because we defined the

2055
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,000
value as an area so when I click on

2056
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,119
progress and if I go to the same uh op

2057
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,679
object so the array it's going to have

2058
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:59,880
the value to do and the end progress and

2059
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,719
uh by uh with the use user react table

2060
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:06,480
Hook from TX so it's going to do the

2061
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,400
filtering for us so that's why we

2062
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,599
defined this function inside the filter

2063
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:15,199
functions property which is a built-in

2064
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:19,080
property inside the user react uh table

2065
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,040
and of course we need to add this check

2066
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,840
stes as a dependency

2067
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,440
so once we set up the filter logic

2068
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,159
inside the react table of course we need

2069
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:33,040
to update our drop down so whenever we

2070
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,960
are clicking on the element here this is

2071
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,960
what we are going to see and if we

2072
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,560
uncheck this so uh the separator is gone

2073
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:48,599
but also the tags that we un clicked so

2074
01:44:48,599 --> 01:44:50,840
uh uh and also we're going to use the

2075
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,599
same logic that we did for the priority

2076
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:57,239
meaning here first we are going to

2077
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:00,000
import these States from the use check

2078
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,800
status store and uh then we're having

2079
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,560
this function so this update function

2080
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,599
it's going to be linked to the on select

2081
01:45:09,599 --> 01:45:12,360
function so uh and also we're going to

2082
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:15,760
pass uh down this function the status.

2083
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,599
label uh to be able to know which

2084
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:20,520
element that we click

2085
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,840
on so the first thing that we're going

2086
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,040
to do we're going to because we're going

2087
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,560
to cast the label as stes since the

2088
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,280
label is going to be string so I did the

2089
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:33,239
same thing just to make sure that we are

2090
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:36,080
safe uh we are going to validate this

2091
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,639
label first based on this areay then we

2092
01:45:39,639 --> 01:45:42,360
can be able to safely cast it as a

2093
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,320
status and uh then we are going to check

2094
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,679
if this uh label that we clicked on is

2095
01:45:48,679 --> 01:45:52,560
included inside the uh the array the

2096
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,719
checks States so if it is so we're going

2097
01:45:55,719 --> 01:45:57,280
to delete it meaning that when we

2098
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,920
clicked on it so it's already Happ been

2099
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,280
and the uh uh in the area so it's going

2100
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,000
to be uh

2101
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,520
deleted otherwise we're going to add the

2102
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,119
actual uh

2103
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:12,560
States and then we're going to update

2104
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,080
the checked uh States so when this is

2105
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:20,480
updated eventually and the task table

2106
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,520
since this is updated because this is is

2107
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,560
uh is added as an area dependency so

2108
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,440
it's going to actually trigger this part

2109
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,920
to be able to to by itself trigger the

2110
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,719
filtering function inside the uh use

2111
01:46:35,719 --> 01:46:37,960
react uh

2112
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,360
table so uh here so the count stages so

2113
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,880
we're going to use it to be able to

2114
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,679
actually count the uh the tasks that has

2115
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:51,880
the uh filter back uh the status backlog

2116
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,440
to do cancel and done and in in progress

2117
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,560
and we're using the use memo hook

2118
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,880
because uh you can't use the use effects

2119
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,840
use effect doesn't return a value but uh

2120
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,719
use memo hook uh runs pretty much the

2121
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,920
same as use effect hook but uh it

2122
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,560
Returns the value uh or uh it returns

2123
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,840
something that we can be able to use to

2124
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,960
uh inside the GSX so uh here uh we are

2125
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,760
going to use this inside the chest X so

2126
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,840
this is the area and uh in this area

2127
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,119
we're having the latest updated values

2128
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:34,159
with that we can use to actually show uh

2129
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,719
the numbers uh here the real numbers

2130
01:47:37,719 --> 01:47:40,719
that are coming from the task area so

2131
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,360
this is why we use this so the GSX is

2132
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,639
pretty much the same that that that that

2133
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:49,719
we used inside the priority filter so

2134
01:47:49,719 --> 01:47:52,679
I'm not going to go through this twice

2135
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:54,639
and and this is basically how we can be

2136
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:59,159
able to create our uh status uh filter

2137
01:47:59,159 --> 01:48:03,920
so after we completed the uh filter um

2138
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,440
section so the next thing that I want to

2139
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,639
show you is a little update in the data

2140
01:48:09,639 --> 01:48:12,840
so and also I want to show you when the

2141
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,960
application is first loaded so we're

2142
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,719
going to have this uh skeleton then we

2143
01:48:17,719 --> 01:48:23,080
can be able to access to the uh data so

2144
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,080
the way how we're going to use the area

2145
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,760
is going to be a little bit different

2146
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,239
because we're going to simulate the

2147
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:31,480
fiction of the data and we're going to

2148
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,960
use the set timeout and also we're going

2149
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:37,760
to use uh Zas jent so uh let's go back

2150
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,000
to the vs code and uh just to show you

2151
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,440
what I'm talking about here inside the

2152
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,520
used tasks data store so uh because

2153
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,000
we're not going to use the back end

2154
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,679
we're going to just focus on the front

2155
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,159
end so we're going to use set timeout to

2156
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,719
be able to actually uh simulate the

2157
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,320
fiction of the data so this is the story

2158
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,400
that we are going to create so uh I'm

2159
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,320
going to start from here because we can

2160
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,040
be able to see the structure of our

2161
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,040
store so we're having the tasks the set

2162
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:13,599
so the tasks going to be of type tasks

2163
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,560
as an array or null the selected task

2164
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,880
it's going to be of uh so uh this one

2165
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:23,760
we're going to be uh using uh for for uh

2166
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,400
editing the

2167
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:30,520
task so just uh like uh ignore uh this

2168
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,880
one and this one and we're having the

2169
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,360
set tasks to be able to update the tasks

2170
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,880
areay and fch method which is a promise

2171
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,480
of uh type void meaning that it's not

2172
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,639
going to return anything so the task is

2173
01:49:45,639 --> 01:49:48,960
going to be first uh by default as null

2174
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,520
uh so ignore this one and we're having

2175
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,639
the set task to be able to update the

2176
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:57,000
task that we are going to use in our

2177
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,639
project and also we're having the fetch

2178
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:02,080
tasks so here we're going to use the TR

2179
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,760
catch block and as I uh said we're going

2180
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,040
to use the promise of type void and then

2181
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:11,560
after 1,000 uh milliseconds meaning 1

2182
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,719
seconds we are going to update the tasks

2183
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,639
array uh by using the set method with

2184
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:23,599
the uh with the tasks uh with the tasks

2185
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,880
area that is coming from uh the tasks

2186
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,280
data uh the task data which is uh this

2187
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,719
file so this is basically how you can be

2188
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:35,679
able to Fitch or simulate the fing of

2189
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,040
the data so it's a pretty

2190
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,280
straightforward uh code and it's very

2191
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:44,119
easy to set up so after we did this so

2192
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:46,159
we're going to do some minor adjustments

2193
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:50,360
in our code so let me close all the uh

2194
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,719
tabs and I'm going to start from the

2195
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,320
task tasks or I'm going to start from

2196
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,239
the page. GSX which is the homepage of

2197
01:50:59,239 --> 01:51:00,639
our

2198
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:02,920
application so here to be able to

2199
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,440
actually call The Fitch tasks so you can

2200
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,719
be able to update the tasks state so we

2201
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,639
need to use it from this store and then

2202
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:13,679
we're going to use this user fix hook so

2203
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:16,400
whenever the uh home functional

2204
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,239
components is mounted meaning that the

2205
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:20,320
application is working then we're going

2206
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,920
to call this uh this this um this

2207
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,719
function and then it's going to update

2208
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:28,280
the tasks uh state that we can be able

2209
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:31,920
to use inside the task area. GSX so if

2210
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:36,000
we go to this to this file again as you

2211
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,239
can see we are going to uh access to the

2212
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:41,760
tasks State and here at the bottom so

2213
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,520
we're going to add this turn operator so

2214
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,440
if the tasks is null so as I said as I

2215
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,960
showed you it could be tasks of type

2216
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,159
tasks or null so if it is null we're

2217
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:55,040
going to call all the table skeleton

2218
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,239
components and so so this is the actual

2219
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:01,280
file uh to be able to create the

2220
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,040
skeleton and also make sure to uh

2221
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,679
install the skeleton component from Shad

2222
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:09,159
CN so if we go here just type in

2223
01:52:09,159 --> 01:52:12,280
skeleton here and just copy this and

2224
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,480
paste it in terminal to be able to

2225
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:18,000
access to the skeleton components like

2226
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,079
this so we're having the uh table so the

2227
01:52:23,079 --> 01:52:25,960
uh T head the table head and we're

2228
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:31,040
having the table uh body so after

2229
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,639
this so when the table is not null then

2230
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,199
we can be able to or filled then we can

2231
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,679
be able to safely access to the tasks

2232
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:42,639
table uh

2233
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:45,599
component and this is what is happening

2234
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:49,199
in our application so first it's going

2235
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,400
uh we're have we're going to have the

2236
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,760
skeleton because the task state is null

2237
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,639
then we can be able to access to the

2238
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:58,800
table since the tasks is filled with the

2239
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,560
data and also finally we're going to do

2240
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,760
some minor adjustments inside the

2241
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,520
priority uh drop down and the status

2242
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,000
drop down so instead of using directly

2243
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,320
the tasks from the static static data so

2244
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,639
we're going to use it from the used

2245
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,880
tasks uh data store so the same thing

2246
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:21,719
that I did for the stated uh the status

2247
01:53:21,719 --> 01:53:24,520
drop downs so we're going to access to

2248
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,199
the tasks

2249
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:31,560
area uh or state from this uh store so

2250
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,599
uh uh this uh I should uh did this

2251
01:53:36,599 --> 01:53:39,400
before I start uh you know creating the

2252
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:44,320
filters but uh so I have to do this now

2253
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,760
uh because we're going to rely on it uh

2254
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,840
when we are going to add and delete and

2255
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,520
modify especially when we're going to

2256
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,000
work on this uh drop drop down to be

2257
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,880
able to modify and update each task so

2258
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,159
the next feature that I added is the

2259
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:01,320
ability to hide the colons if you want

2260
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,679
to so when I click on view and I click

2261
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:07,119
on stages so it's going to be hidden and

2262
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:11,880
uh also um we can be able to hide it

2263
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:16,040
just from here and if we want to uh show

2264
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,760
it back uh all we have to do just click

2265
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,079
on the stages so there is uh there is a

2266
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:25,920
a sync uh between the table and this uh

2267
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,520
drop down but for the title we're not

2268
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,280
going to be able to hide the title which

2269
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,639
is the the the main element in our table

2270
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:37,960
to be able to filter by and also to show

2271
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,599
uh the

2272
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:43,800
tasks so uh let's go back to the vs code

2273
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,560
and uh so the first thing that we are

2274
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:48,719
going to be doing uh inside the tasks

2275
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:51,199
colum inside the specifically inside the

2276
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,960
sortable header

2277
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,480
so here we are going to add this uh on

2278
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,599
click event listener colon. tole

2279
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:00,960
visibility so it is a built-in function

2280
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,520
from chq to be able to actually hide the

2281
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,520
actual um column and only if the label

2282
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,400
is different than the title since we're

2283
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:13,280
using the sortable uh header as a

2284
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:18,400
reusable function in every um in every

2285
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,520
uh column every object so it's going to

2286
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:26,040
actually ignore the title and do it for

2287
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:32,199
the uh remaining um uh cols so after we

2288
01:55:32,199 --> 01:55:35,320
did this so we're going to do uh some

2289
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,920
modification inside the view columns

2290
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:43,119
drop down so uh here as you can see um

2291
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:46,719
the actual file or code it's going to be

2292
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,360
uh completely different so here we are

2293
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:52,480
going to accept the table uh from the

2294
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,840
print component and we're going to use

2295
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,320
this table so because we're going to use

2296
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:01,560
it uh in here to be able to actually um

2297
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,719
hide the column that uh we want so we're

2298
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,040
going to use all of these uh functions

2299
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,800
the get all columns from and we're

2300
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,239
going to use the dod filter colum to be

2301
01:56:13,239 --> 01:56:19,560
able to actually uh hide the uh

2302
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,520
column so after we did this we're going

2303
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,440
to call this component inside the tasks

2304
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:30,079
area so here uh in the tasks area as you

2305
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:33,239
can see we're going to use the table but

2306
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:37,079
uh uh one um adjustment a big adjustment

2307
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:39,239
that I did since we're going to use the

2308
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:42,599
table in this component so because the

2309
01:56:42,599 --> 01:56:45,760
US react hook table is inside this tasks

2310
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,639
table so what I did I uh took it one

2311
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,639
layer up and I I put all the code that

2312
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:59,599
uh handles uh the uh the change inside

2313
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,719
the hook in here so as you can see all

2314
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:07,960
the code that was inside so let me go to

2315
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,960
the task table so the task table so

2316
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,920
right now is uh uh is uh it doesn't have

2317
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,599
a lot of code uh because we took all the

2318
01:57:18,599 --> 01:57:22,920
logic into the print component so and

2319
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,800
basically what I did so instead of uh

2320
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,639
using the data so we're going to use uh

2321
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:32,639
the table so I just uh updated the data

2322
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,360
uh table prompts and I added the table

2323
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,800
in here and also make sure because the

2324
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,560
name uh uh the names are going to be the

2325
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:44,599
same for the table uh from the shadan

2326
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:48,840
component and the type from CHC so I

2327
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,239
named it as a Shad and table and I took

2328
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:57,040
this and I put it in here into the uh

2329
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:01,119
GSX so uh let's go back to the tasks

2330
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:06,679
area. GSX and uh also I did uh a change

2331
01:58:06,679 --> 01:58:08,480
inside the data so we're going to use

2332
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,440
the tasks so if it is null it's going to

2333
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,000
be an array and the columns we're going

2334
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,560
to use the tasks column from this file

2335
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:20,199
so basically all the other code it's

2336
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:22,119
it's going to remain the same and then

2337
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:24,560
then we can be able to use this table

2338
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,599
and pass it down to this drop- down view

2339
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,239
colum component so uh this is basically

2340
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:33,960
the change that I did to make sure that

2341
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:37,239
the view or the hiding of the colons uh

2342
01:58:37,239 --> 01:58:40,840
work uh correctly so now we are going to

2343
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:44,639
start working on updating the task and

2344
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:47,159
the first uh feature that we're going to

2345
01:58:47,159 --> 01:58:51,000
be adding is to be able to make a task

2346
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,199
favorite or unor favorite so here

2347
01:58:54,199 --> 01:58:59,079
depending on the state of the the task

2348
01:58:59,079 --> 01:59:01,480
whether it's favorite or not so we're

2349
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:04,560
going to see this changing so because

2350
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:07,119
this is already favorite so we're going

2351
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:10,560
to have the in favorite but if we go to

2352
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,760
a task that is not favorite so we're

2353
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,400
going to have or set it as favorite so

2354
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:19,280
when we click on it so as you can see

2355
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:22,719
it's we're going to have this store icon

2356
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,760
meaning that this is s as favorite but

2357
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:29,400
when I click on the drop down again I'm

2358
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:32,000
going to have the in favorite and if I

2359
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,280
want to make this in favorite I click on

2360
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:37,360
it so it's going to update the uh

2361
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:41,960
favorite uh property and the store it's

2362
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,520
gone so we're going to work on this

2363
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,320
feature so first uh the uh First Step

2364
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,360
that we are going to be doing so we're

2365
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:53,000
going to start from the tasks Colum

2366
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
GSX so here uh what we are going to do

2367
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,760
we are going to use this function

2368
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:01,840
because here uh so I already showed you

2369
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,159
in the uh used task uh data store I

2370
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:09,679
showed you uh the selected task so uh

2371
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:12,119
here we're going to use it to be able to

2372
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:15,560
actually store the task that we clicked

2373
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:18,560
on in the uh selected task so we can be

2374
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,599
able to use it to actually update its

2375
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,920
value to know which task that we clicked

2376
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:29,679
on so in the tasks colon so uh since we

2377
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:32,400
can't be able to use a custom hook

2378
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:35,920
inside the array so what we did uh we

2379
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,360
are going to create a function and we're

2380
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:42,320
going to pass down the task as a prompt

2381
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,719
and uh here we can be able to actually

2382
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:48,000
call the task drop down component so the

2383
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,920
reason why we did so so we can be able

2384
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:55,119
to use the set selected task so uh here

2385
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:58,760
in the tasks uh drop down uh functional

2386
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:00,639
component we did an update so we're

2387
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,079
going to create these two call back

2388
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:06,320
functions so when this is open so we're

2389
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:10,119
going to update the selected task by the

2390
02:01:10,119 --> 02:01:12,280
task that is coming from The Prompt

2391
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:14,719
otherwise when it is closed it's going

2392
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,360
to be uh null and to make this call back

2393
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,800
function uh working so we're going to go

2394
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,880
to the tasks drop down functional

2395
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,639
component so first we need to add the

2396
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:30,119
signature of each call back function and

2397
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:33,679
these callback functions are going to be

2398
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:37,679
uh uh triggered dependent on the open uh

2399
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:41,280
value inside the open on open change

2400
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:45,719
event listener so when the uh when we uh

2401
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:49,000
open the drop down so this it's going to

2402
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,840
trigger and so if the open is through uh

2403
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:56,440
then we are going to uh actually uh call

2404
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:59,520
the open onopen call back function where

2405
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,679
it's what what what is going to call

2406
02:02:02,679 --> 02:02:07,280
this uh as a result and then update the

2407
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,360
uh selected task with the task that is

2408
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:12,520
coming from its parent component which

2409
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:16,560
is uh this part and when this is false

2410
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,880
so it's going to do this the same thing

2411
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,639
but now we are going to trigger or call

2412
02:02:21,639 --> 02:02:25,040
the on close callback

2413
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:28,560
function so so that's uh the first

2414
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,199
update uh that I did and the second

2415
02:02:32,199 --> 02:02:36,840
update is uh if we go to the uh menu

2416
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:41,119
items. gs6 or let's go to its uh to the

2417
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:44,560
main component which is tasks drop down

2418
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,960
so here as you can see um I added the

2419
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,400
selected task from the used task data

2420
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,440
store but also instead of using the menu

2421
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,560
items constant so then uh we are going

2422
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:02,400
to use it inside the menu items area

2423
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:06,480
State and with with it seter uh because

2424
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,320
what we want here when we open up the

2425
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:12,639
drop down we want to uh we want to

2426
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:16,880
actually uh show the uh opposite of the

2427
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,320
favorite state so if it is false so we

2428
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:22,599
want to show this as favorite so when

2429
02:03:22,599 --> 02:03:26,639
the favorite is uh true we want to show

2430
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,840
this as an favorite so this is what this

2431
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,239
use effect hooks

2432
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:34,599
does so actually we're going to use

2433
02:03:34,599 --> 02:03:37,440
directly the set menu items array and

2434
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,639
we're going to use the previous array

2435
02:03:39,639 --> 02:03:40,960
and then we're going to Loop through

2436
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,960
each item and here I added a new

2437
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:47,400
property called kind so if we go to the

2438
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,800
types so as you can see I add the kind

2439
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,480
just to know uh whether we're going to

2440
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:58,760
uh to uh actually uh uh click on the

2441
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:00,800
favorite the copy of the edit or the

2442
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,040
delete so I added this and uh also

2443
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,679
inside the constant. TS so as you can

2444
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,840
see I added the kind property so this

2445
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:13,599
for this is the edit this is the copy

2446
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:16,559
and this is the favorite so that's why

2447
02:04:16,559 --> 02:04:19,639
we saw the so want to make sure that we

2448
02:04:19,639 --> 02:04:22,360
are going to access to the element that

2449
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:25,719
is uh that is for the favorite so this

2450
02:04:25,719 --> 02:04:28,400
is what the if statement does so we're

2451
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,400
going to check if the kind is equal to

2452
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:33,199
favorite then we're going to update the

2453
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:36,599
object so uh here we're going to only

2454
02:04:36,599 --> 02:04:38,920
update the label depending on the

2455
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:41,880
selected task so if it is favorite we're

2456
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:45,000
going to show the unfavorite otherwise

2457
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,679
we're going to show the favorite so and

2458
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:49,880
this is going to be dependent upon the

2459
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:53,119
selected task state

2460
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:57,440
so after doing this um we are going to

2461
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:01,960
go to the menu items. GSX and uh in here

2462
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,440
we're going to call all of these

2463
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,840
elements from the store and we're going

2464
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,639
to add the onclick event listener so

2465
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:12,760
whenever we click on the uh on any item

2466
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,280
in here so this is going to be triggered

2467
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:19,880
so uh this handle menu items click event

2468
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:23,199
listener I added inside the .ts just to

2469
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:26,360
organize stuff so those are the

2470
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:28,639
properties or the components or the

2471
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:31,639
prompts that we're going to be using for

2472
02:05:31,639 --> 02:05:34,239
this function and we're going to use the

2473
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:38,199
switch method or case uh uh based on the

2474
02:05:38,199 --> 02:05:40,840
kind so if it is favorite so then we are

2475
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:43,679
going to actually trigger all of this

2476
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:46,800
code to be able to update the uh

2477
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,639
favorite

2478
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:51,320
property and here as you can see we are

2479
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:55,119
going to call the update uh task so this

2480
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:59,199
update task it is coming from this uh

2481
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:02,119
use task data store so I added this

2482
02:06:02,119 --> 02:06:04,400
function to be able to actually uh

2483
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,000
update the tasks so this is the

2484
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,679
signature of it so it's going to have

2485
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:13,119
the tasks as uh first parameter and the

2486
02:06:13,119 --> 02:06:15,480
operation and there is a promise that is

2487
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,599
going to return this object but also

2488
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,320
we're going to use this update tasks

2489
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,719
function to be able to actually update

2490
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:25,440
date the whole uh data when we want to

2491
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,440
edit or delete but we're going to get

2492
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,040
into this later on so this is the update

2493
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,760
tasks function so we're having this

2494
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:36,320
switch uh statement so based on because

2495
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:39,079
we're are going to use the toast uh the

2496
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:41,960
toast to be able to actually uh show the

2497
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:45,760
messages based on the operation and here

2498
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,880
we're having the try and catch block we

2499
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,880
are going to use the promise and uh here

2500
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,040
we are going to actually update the

2501
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,760
updated tasks area that is coming from

2502
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,920
this prompt and then we're going to

2503
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:00,760
return the object which is success as

2504
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,440
true and the message uh that is defined

2505
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,599
with the success message depending on

2506
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:08,159
the

2507
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:10,679
operation so this is basically how we

2508
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:13,239
can be able to create this so as you can

2509
02:07:13,239 --> 02:07:16,760
see there it is a bit complicated and I

2510
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:19,840
had to uh update and adjust many things

2511
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,679
but once this is set up it's it's going

2512
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:24,159
to be very easy for us to be able to

2513
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:28,000
work with the edit the copy and also the

2514
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,119
deletion the label it's going to we're

2515
02:07:30,119 --> 02:07:33,440
going to add some code uh for this uh

2516
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,440
because uh there is some logic need to

2517
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,920
be added to be able to actually uh

2518
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:42,480
update the uh actual uh features or uh

2519
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:45,400
labels so after we can be able to

2520
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,880
actually set the task as favorite or not

2521
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:50,639
so uh two things that we are going to

2522
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:54,960
add and the drop down so uh we can be

2523
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,760
able to make a copy so when I click on a

2524
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,960
cop make a copy so this is actually

2525
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,000
what's going to happen so it's going to

2526
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,559
be copied successfully but also we're

2527
02:08:05,559 --> 02:08:07,880
going to have this toast notification

2528
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:10,400
using Shad CN so we're going to install

2529
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:13,239
this and also I added the delete

2530
02:08:13,239 --> 02:08:16,679
deletion function so as you can see the

2531
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:20,239
actual task has been uh deleted

2532
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:21,760
successfully

2533
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,639
but first I want to show you the steps

2534
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:26,119
to be able to install the toast from

2535
02:08:26,119 --> 02:08:30,079
chat CN so it's a very simple uh process

2536
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:33,639
so we need first to install this uh uh

2537
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:36,960
component and then what we are going to

2538
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,880
do are going to add the toaster in the

2539
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,000
layout. GSX so if we go to the layout.

2540
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,239
GSX uh here as you can see we're going

2541
02:08:47,239 --> 02:08:49,960
to put it under the children and it's

2542
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,000
going to be within the theme

2543
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,639
provider tag so once we did this then we

2544
02:08:55,639 --> 02:08:59,280
can be able to use the uh the

2545
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:03,239
toast so we need to use or uh import the

2546
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:05,400
used toast hook and then we can be able

2547
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:08,119
to use it like this in any component

2548
02:09:08,119 --> 02:09:10,920
that you want so I'm going to show you

2549
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,880
uh step by step how to be able to uh use

2550
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:17,840
it so let me uh Delete all the tabs just

2551
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,880
to show you everything step by Steps

2552
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:24,360
step byep step clearly so the first

2553
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:29,119
thing that I did so I did uh a change

2554
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:30,679
inside the

2555
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:34,239
.ts so here into the prompt so this is

2556
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:39,320
the type of the toast so um and uh also

2557
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,719
we are going to use the toast and the

2558
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:46,280
toast toaster toast uh basically these

2559
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:49,000
jpes I couldn't find them but I had to

2560
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,520
do a minor change in in their uh file so

2561
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,599
if we go to the

2562
02:09:55,599 --> 02:10:01,239
.ts so here I had to export so uh it has

2563
02:10:01,239 --> 02:10:04,520
not been exported probably they uh

2564
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,800
forgot to add the export key keyword

2565
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,679
here to be able to use the toaster toast

2566
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:15,840
and uh also I added another uh export of

2567
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:19,920
the type which is the toast type so let

2568
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:25,440
me check uh or look for the toast so

2569
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:29,440
there are actually a lot of uh there are

2570
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:33,719
a lot of uh results so let me close this

2571
02:10:33,719 --> 02:10:38,000
and I'm going to find this manually so I

2572
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,000
forgot where the toast type exists so

2573
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,599
anyway

2574
02:10:44,599 --> 02:10:48,079
um so here is so this is the toose type

2575
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:50,840
so make sure to export it because we

2576
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:54,440
need it uh in here to be able to define

2577
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:57,520
the structure of the toast and the uh

2578
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,920
actual prop so as you can see we're

2579
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,920
going to import the toast and the toast

2580
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,520
toaster toast and to be able to get this

2581
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:09,679
actually signature so here if we go to

2582
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:12,800
the menu items so this is uh how we're

2583
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,280
going to use the used toast H so all you

2584
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,800
have to do just overover over this and

2585
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:20,040
just copy all this

2586
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:22,960
signature and just based it in here to

2587
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,719
be able to use the toast which is a

2588
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:30,840
function in uh this uh switch uh

2589
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:35,159
statement so uh so that's the uh first

2590
02:11:35,159 --> 02:11:38,920
thing and also I did uh I added the kind

2591
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:41,760
parameter inside the prompts of the menu

2592
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,760
item so you can be able to use this into

2593
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,960
and pass it down into the handle menu

2594
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,000
item click so uh basically what I was

2595
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,719
doing I was just adding than the

2596
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:54,800
favorite but now it's going to depend on

2597
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,119
the kind that is coming from the print

2598
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,400
component which is the task drop drop

2599
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:03,159
down so this is the actual menu item so

2600
02:12:03,159 --> 02:12:06,400
each item that we are looping through so

2601
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:09,400
it's going to have its own kind property

2602
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,679
so we are going to pass down inside the

2603
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:14,320
menu item so we can be able to use it

2604
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,880
inside this uh

2605
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:21,280
function and uh after this inside the

2606
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:25,760
this function so I added a new uh case

2607
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,520
which is copy so uh basically when the

2608
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:33,000
kind is equal to copy this is going to

2609
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,280
be actually uh triggered so the first

2610
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,400
thing that we are going to do we're

2611
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,800
going to create a new concept called

2612
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:43,239
copy task with of type task of course so

2613
02:12:43,239 --> 02:12:45,280
we're going to use the three dot

2614
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,280
selected tasks uh to be able to just

2615
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:51,920
gerine uh all the previous elements so

2616
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:55,159
these things that are going to change so

2617
02:12:55,159 --> 02:12:58,280
the task ID so we are going to define a

2618
02:12:58,280 --> 02:13:01,000
new uh three numbers so we're going to

2619
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,199
use the simple function to be able to

2620
02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:07,440
actually return three R numbers randomly

2621
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,280
so this function I added it inside the

2622
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:13,440
functions folder just to make things

2623
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,760
organized for our project so if we go

2624
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:20,040
back to the uh menu item or the utils

2625
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,880
that is to continue continue explaining

2626
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:24,719
the code here so the title it's going to

2627
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,800
come from the selected task. title and

2628
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,679
here we're going to add the

2629
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:32,400
copy and uh finally we are going to

2630
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,800
create to add uh to assign a new date

2631
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:38,199
which is the current date inside the

2632
02:13:38,199 --> 02:13:40,840
created ad property so once we created

2633
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:44,280
our object then we're going to add uh so

2634
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:46,760
we're going to create a new copy of the

2635
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:49,679
tasks by using the uh the spread

2636
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:52,199
operator and then we're going to add

2637
02:13:52,199 --> 02:13:54,079
this new object and then we're going to

2638
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:57,320
call the update task and we're going to

2639
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:01,440
add in in it the added add copy task and

2640
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:04,119
here we're going to add the copy so just

2641
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:07,320
to remind you why we did the copy here

2642
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,920
because in the function so let's go back

2643
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,679
to the use tasks data store so for the

2644
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:16,559
function as you can see here in the

2645
02:14:16,559 --> 02:14:19,079
prompt it's going to accept the

2646
02:14:19,079 --> 02:14:21,760
operation but it's going to be op

2647
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,599
so that's why we used inde defined so

2648
02:14:24,599 --> 02:14:27,520
once this is equal to copy then we're

2649
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:32,520
going to return this uh message so again

2650
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:35,440
if we go back to the application and we

2651
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,440
click make copy so as you can see we're

2652
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,639
going to have this uh this uh message

2653
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:44,440
and this message is coming from from

2654
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:48,679
here so that's why we added in the .ts

2655
02:14:48,679 --> 02:14:52,400
we added the copy uh operation or

2656
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,480
operator here and then we're going to

2657
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,719
use the toast to be able to actually

2658
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:59,119
show the toast and that's why we

2659
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:00,960
actually Define it or edit inside the

2660
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:03,320
promp and find the signature that I just

2661
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:07,000
explained how to do so and here for the

2662
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,760
deletion so when we click on the delete

2663
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:12,119
so this is going to be triggered and

2664
02:15:12,119 --> 02:15:15,119
basically we we need to get uh rid from

2665
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:17,040
the element that we want to delete that

2666
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:18,960
we selected so we're going to use the

2667
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:21,599
filter method and then we're going do

2668
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:24,400
the same thing call the update tasks and

2669
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:27,199
we're going to add the delete operation

2670
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:30,239
here and finally we are going to return

2671
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,960
the actual uh message depending on the

2672
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:36,960
result so if the since the function

2673
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,760
returns a promise of an object that has

2674
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:43,079
the success property so if it is true so

2675
02:15:43,079 --> 02:15:45,000
we're going to use the default variant

2676
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,079
otherwise we're going to use the

2677
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:48,559
destructive and for the title so we're

2678
02:15:48,559 --> 02:15:50,440
going to depend again on the sex

2679
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,960
property

2680
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,480
to be able to actually uh show the title

2681
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:57,920
whether it's successful or filled and

2682
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:00,040
then we're going to use the delete

2683
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,679
result that message that is coming from

2684
02:16:02,679 --> 02:16:06,199
the function that I just showed you so

2685
02:16:06,199 --> 02:16:08,840
basically this is how I updated the code

2686
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:12,440
to make sure that we can copy and delete

2687
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:15,079
the task that we want and the next

2688
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:17,800
feature that I added is the ability to

2689
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:22,000
change the label so when I uh um hover

2690
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
over the label so uh first we are going

2691
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,360
to um so we're going to have the uh

2692
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:31,519
selected labels so when I click on

2693
02:16:31,519 --> 02:16:34,120
feature so as you can see the feature

2694
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:36,880
has been uh the label has been updated

2695
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:40,000
along with the uh actual chose

2696
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,840
notification telling us that uh the

2697
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:46,319
operation has been successful so let's

2698
02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:48,800
go back to the vsod to show you what I

2699
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:51,559
did so the first thing that I'm going to

2700
02:16:51,559 --> 02:16:55,200
start from as the subl label

2701
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,880
menu so here what I did I added this

2702
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:02,080
onclick uh label item which is a call

2703
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:06,080
back function to be able to actually um

2704
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:10,240
get uh or take the uh the value that we

2705
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:13,120
changed and take it up to the print

2706
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:16,319
component so when we go to the print

2707
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:20,120
component which is the task drop item so

2708
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:23,200
as you can see here we're having the

2709
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,319
onclick uh item label so uh here we are

2710
02:17:27,319 --> 02:17:31,240
going to link this to this function so

2711
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:34,559
in this function this is where the magic

2712
02:17:34,559 --> 02:17:37,000
happens but first I want to just show

2713
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,760
you very quickly the user effect hook so

2714
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,240
this actually uh what it does it's going

2715
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,840
to update the uh selected label so

2716
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:50,479
whenever we open up the uh the menu so

2717
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:54,399
we can can uh the um the selection or

2718
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:56,639
the label it's going to be selected

2719
02:17:56,639 --> 02:18:00,479
depending upon the uh label inside the

2720
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:02,479
selected task so now because it is

2721
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:04,200
feature so we're going to have the

2722
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,960
feature selected and if you go to this

2723
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:08,479
task and we

2724
02:18:08,479 --> 02:18:12,679
hover so let me let me uh go to another

2725
02:18:12,679 --> 02:18:16,439
one uh so I don't know why this still

2726
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:19,920
here so if we go to this task and hover

2727
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:21,479
over the labels so we're going to have

2728
02:18:21,479 --> 02:18:24,000
the documentation label because this

2729
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,920
task is labeled with the doc

2730
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:30,519
documentation tag so that's the first

2731
02:18:30,519 --> 02:18:33,399
thing and uh here so this is the

2732
02:18:33,399 --> 02:18:37,080
function so uh for this part is just to

2733
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,559
validate that this new label because

2734
02:18:39,559 --> 02:18:42,840
we're going to uh cast it so we want to

2735
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:46,760
make sure that it's going it's valid uh

2736
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:50,960
before we can uh cast this so and we are

2737
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:53,359
going to check if the selected task and

2738
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:55,719
the task are not undefined because this

2739
02:18:55,719 --> 02:18:59,160
could be null and this could be null as

2740
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:04,559
well and then we are going to update the

2741
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:07,000
uh label with the new label that is

2742
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,800
coming from the promp of the function

2743
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:12,120
and here we can be able to safely cast

2744
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:14,439
this as a label because we already

2745
02:19:14,439 --> 02:19:18,599
validated inside this if statement and

2746
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:21,840
then we are going to actually up update

2747
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:25,920
the uh the task and uh here we are going

2748
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:28,920
to create a new uh array and we're going

2749
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:33,040
to use the M function and if the task ID

2750
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:36,160
is equal to the task ID of the selected

2751
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:40,639
task then we're going to use the updated

2752
02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:41,840
uh

2753
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,080
task which is uh this one otherwise for

2754
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:50,479
the other elements that uh uh that don't

2755
02:19:50,479 --> 02:19:51,479
uh

2756
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:54,880
uh that uh uh don't have this condition

2757
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:59,120
then we're going to uh their object will

2758
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,040
be the same uh sorry for that guys and

2759
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,399
then we're going to have the try and

2760
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:06,880
catch blog and finally we can be able to

2761
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:10,200
safely call the update tasks to be able

2762
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:13,840
to pass inside of it the new uh array so

2763
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:15,680
you can be able to actually update the

2764
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,160
tasks inside the store and here we're

2765
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:21,080
going to just return the uh message is

2766
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:25,200
depending on the uh result so this is

2767
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:28,319
basically how we can be able to actually

2768
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:31,840
create this function so now all of these

2769
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:34,680
functions are working so the last thing

2770
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:37,280
is the edit but first before we start

2771
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:42,080
working on the edit so we need to create

2772
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:46,160
our uh so we need to create um so we

2773
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:49,120
need to add the react hook form to be

2774
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:53,680
able to actually um check all the fields

2775
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,560
uh first and then we can be able to

2776
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:57,960
create our function to add a new task

2777
02:20:57,960 --> 02:21:00,960
inside the

2778
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:03,520
table so now we are going to start

2779
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,800
working on adding a task but the first

2780
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:08,840
thing that I added is the ability to

2781
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:12,600
track the elements and all the fields

2782
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:16,200
that we're having into the uh dialogue

2783
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:17,920
so we're going to make sure that

2784
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:20,240
everything is correct before we can be

2785
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:24,000
able to add a new task and for this

2786
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,240
we're going to use uh packages and

2787
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:29,720
mainly the most popular packages that

2788
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:32,240
we're going to be using is Zod to be

2789
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:34,359
able to actually validate the schema and

2790
02:21:34,359 --> 02:21:36,800
create schemas and then we're going to

2791
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,399
use the react hook form so it's a pretty

2792
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:44,200
popular form to be able to handle a form

2793
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,319
and also to be able to track the fields

2794
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:48,920
and the inputs and also to handle the

2795
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:51,120
errors for us and and then we're going

2796
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,240
to use this packet so we can be able to

2797
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,200
actually link our result schema with the

2798
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:59,280
react hook form as I'm going to show you

2799
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:04,680
in our code so just to show you a very

2800
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:07,359
quick uh demonstration so for example

2801
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:10,520
here we're having title is required and

2802
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:13,640
uh if for example I click on add task

2803
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:15,800
nothing's going to happen and the focus

2804
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:18,960
is going to go back to the actual input

2805
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:21,080
because there is still an error

2806
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:26,200
but if I do this and uh I click on add

2807
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,640
task then we can be able to actually

2808
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:31,840
show the actual object and if I do an

2809
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:34,880
update in one of these fields so just to

2810
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:39,439
show that everything is tracked uh

2811
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:42,439
correctly so let me uh clear out the

2812
02:22:42,439 --> 02:22:45,479
console log and and click on add task so

2813
02:22:45,479 --> 02:22:47,399
as you can see we can we are going to

2814
02:22:47,399 --> 02:22:50,960
get uh in the object all the fields that

2815
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:54,720
we selected so once we hit the stage it

2816
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,640
means that everything is great and we

2817
02:22:57,640 --> 02:23:00,840
can be able to actually use this to add

2818
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,800
them into a database or an area as we

2819
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:08,399
are doing for this particular project so

2820
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:10,399
let's go back to the vs code and the

2821
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:14,600
first thing that make sure to do so make

2822
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:19,920
sure to copy all of these uh and uh uh

2823
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,040
this is for result this is for the hook

2824
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,520
form resolvers and this is for react

2825
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,760
hook form so make sure to add these into

2826
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:30,920
your terminal and H enter to be able to

2827
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:33,560
install them so if we go to the

2828
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:37,160
package.json here so we're going to find

2829
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:41,760
them so here is Zod and uh also we're

2830
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,680
going to find uh react hook uh

2831
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,319
form so and also we're going to you have

2832
02:23:49,319 --> 02:23:52,880
uh the hook form resolvers so it means

2833
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:55,479
that they have been installed

2834
02:23:55,479 --> 02:23:57,640
successfully so the first step that we

2835
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:59,479
are going to be doing is creating our

2836
02:23:59,479 --> 02:24:01,439
schema so we're going to go to the

2837
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:03,560
folder task dialogue where we're having

2838
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:06,240
all the files related to the dialogue

2839
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,920
and I created a new file called task

2840
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:12,279
dialogue schema so here we're going to

2841
02:24:12,279 --> 02:24:15,040
create our schema as you can see so this

2842
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:19,399
is how uh the schema is created using

2843
02:24:19,399 --> 02:24:21,880
zot for the title so it's going to be

2844
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:24,040
string and

2845
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:27,520
if for example if it is less than one

2846
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,520
character so we're going to have title

2847
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:34,080
as required and uh if we uh max out more

2848
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:36,399
than 100 characters so we're going to

2849
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:40,479
have the title is too long so we can I'm

2850
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:43,640
going to just show you this so let's add

2851
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:44,920
more

2852
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:48,520
tasks so it means it shows that it's not

2853
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:51,160
working but the most important think

2854
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:53,520
that is working is when there is empty

2855
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,439
so it's going to show us the title is

2856
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:58,840
required so this you could ignore this

2857
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:00,760
and we're having the states the prior

2858
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:02,640
and the label so we're going to use the

2859
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,359
enum the pchain enum function to be able

2860
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:06,200
to

2861
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:10,560
actually uh create the types as we did

2862
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:14,040
for the label and the priority and

2863
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:17,319
finally we're going to infer this uh to

2864
02:25:17,319 --> 02:25:20,520
be able to by using the type of uh

2865
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,840
keyword to be able to actually extract

2866
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:25,880
all the types from the schema and just

2867
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,600
save them inside the task form data so

2868
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,720
this is the first step then we're going

2869
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,160
to go to the task dialog.

2870
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,560
GSX and the first thing that we should

2871
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:39,040
be doing uh we should be uh importing

2872
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,560
the task form data and the task form

2873
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:44,560
schema but also we should be importing

2874
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:47,359
all of these objects from the packages

2875
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:50,840
that we installed so I'm going to try my

2876
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:52,800
best to explain what is happening in

2877
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:56,399
here so the use form hook so it is from

2878
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:59,160
the react hook form and we are going to

2879
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:02,960
pass the task form data and then inside

2880
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:06,319
this object it accepts the resolver uh

2881
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:09,200
the resolver uh property and we're going

2882
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:12,560
to use the Z resolver from this package

2883
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:15,560
to be able to actually uh assign to it

2884
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:18,800
the schema that we created so this is

2885
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:22,680
how these pack this package has been uh

2886
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:25,359
has been engineered so we need to use

2887
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:28,120
this to make sure that our application

2888
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:30,760
is working then we are going to De

2889
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:34,359
destruct our method and right for now

2890
02:26:34,359 --> 02:26:35,800
we're going to just use the handle

2891
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:38,359
submit function but we're going to be

2892
02:26:38,359 --> 02:26:41,560
adding other elements and properties

2893
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:44,760
from the method uh as we move on with

2894
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:47,840
the task dialogue and here on the submit

2895
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,640
function it's going to accept the data

2896
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:53,359
of task of type task form data and what

2897
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:55,200
we're doing just here we are just

2898
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:58,240
logging out the data and at the bottom

2899
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:01,680
we're going to use the form provider so

2900
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,960
uh the form provider is a provider that

2901
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,760
is uh provided by react to forms you

2902
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:10,439
don't have to create your own provider

2903
02:27:10,439 --> 02:27:13,479
and also to avoid using prompts when you

2904
02:27:13,479 --> 02:27:18,240
want uh because uh all of the uh methods

2905
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:20,600
that that are coming from the use form

2906
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:24,920
hook need to be uh need to be uh need to

2907
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:29,040
go down to each uh sub component uh to

2908
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:33,279
be able to avoid uh uh props so we're

2909
02:27:33,279 --> 02:27:35,080
going to just use the provider just to

2910
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:39,040
make sure our code is uh cleaner so we

2911
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,640
need to wrap so first we need to create

2912
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:43,960
this form tag and we need to wrap

2913
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:47,880
everything in between uh the form tag so

2914
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:49,040
this is where we're going to use the

2915
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,880
onsubmit function

2916
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:53,960
and then we need to wrap the form tag

2917
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:57,000
within the form provider so all the subc

2918
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,960
components can be able to access to the

2919
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:02,359
methods or all the properties that are

2920
02:28:02,359 --> 02:28:06,359
coming from the uh methods uh the

2921
02:28:06,359 --> 02:28:11,120
methods uh uh constant which is this

2922
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:14,479
one so after we did this we're going to

2923
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:18,600
go to the task title so let me go to the

2924
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:20,880
task title and this this is how we can

2925
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:24,520
be able to actually access to the

2926
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:27,359
methods uh from the print component so

2927
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:30,040
we're going to use the use form context

2928
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:32,479
so to be able to to to to understand

2929
02:28:32,479 --> 02:28:34,520
this you should be familiar with the

2930
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:35,760
context

2931
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:40,600
API uh which is a built-in context uh uh

2932
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:43,200
logic uh from react so you should be

2933
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,560
familiar with this be able to understand

2934
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:48,520
why we did so so here we can be able to

2935
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:52,200
access to the Reg and the form State uh

2936
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,000
and also we can be able to access to all

2937
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,040
of these elements so we're not going to

2938
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:58,760
need them for the task title and then

2939
02:28:58,760 --> 02:29:00,760
we're going to use the register inside

2940
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:03,240
the input and we're going to use the key

2941
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:04,160
that we

2942
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:06,880
used inside the schema so make sure to

2943
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:11,120
use the same to the same key that we did

2944
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:13,640
that we created for our schema to be

2945
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:17,479
able to actually track this input so

2946
02:29:17,479 --> 02:29:19,319
here as you can see we don't have to use

2947
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:24,160
the on on on uh on change uh uh um

2948
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:26,279
listener and we don't have to use any

2949
02:29:26,279 --> 02:29:28,720
states because everything is handled by

2950
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:32,000
the use form hook and then we can be

2951
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,880
able to access to the errors object and

2952
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:38,720
then so because we are adding the task

2953
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,960
form data since this is it accepts a

2954
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:45,439
generic type so if I do this so it's

2955
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:47,800
going to give me all the

2956
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:51,760
properties uh that we uh that we created

2957
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,439
because we're having the task form data

2958
02:29:54,439 --> 02:29:58,080
type we added inside the use form uh

2959
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:02,040
context so this is a cool feature uh

2960
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:04,760
with typescript and the react hook form

2961
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:09,720
just to make sure that the logic uh the

2962
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:12,319
logic is handled correctly I don't have

2963
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:14,359
any bugs and then we can be able to

2964
02:30:14,359 --> 02:30:17,240
access the message that we defined in

2965
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:20,600
the schema which is this one so this is

2966
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:23,880
for the task title so uh the next

2967
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:25,760
element I'm going to go to the task

2968
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:28,880
label. GSX so here because we're going

2969
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:29,760
to

2970
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:33,960
use because we're going to use for the

2971
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:36,279
uh selection we're going to use this

2972
02:30:36,279 --> 02:30:39,000
custom uh component that is provided by

2973
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,040
Shad Cen so here uh things are going to

2974
02:30:42,040 --> 02:30:44,640
be a little bit different and to be able

2975
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:48,560
to do so uh the react uh form Library

2976
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:52,520
provided for us an object called control

2977
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:55,680
so we are going to actually get this

2978
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:58,399
from the use form context and then we're

2979
02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:01,160
going to create this controller object

2980
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:03,880
which is also provided by react choke

2981
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:06,640
form package as you can see and here we

2982
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:09,120
are going to use the render method to be

2983
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:12,439
able to actually render this custom

2984
02:31:12,439 --> 02:31:16,240
component from chaden and uh it is a

2985
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:20,080
function that it accepts the field uh

2986
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:22,560
parameter and we can be able to use the

2987
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:25,319
field to be able to actually update the

2988
02:31:25,319 --> 02:31:29,880
state within this function so the value

2989
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:32,000
is going to be field that value and the

2990
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,760
on value change event listener so it's

2991
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:37,319
going to accept the value parameter of

2992
02:31:37,319 --> 02:31:40,240
type task form data which to be able to

2993
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:44,880
access to the label or to the uh literal

2994
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,200
types that are coming from the label

2995
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:49,680
property so that's why we did so and

2996
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,319
when whenever this is changing it's

2997
02:31:51,319 --> 02:31:53,640
going to trigger this to be able to

2998
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:57,760
actually update the field uh value so

2999
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,960
the management of the stat it's going to

3000
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:03,720
be done within the render function and

3001
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:06,720
all of this it's going to remain uh the

3002
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:10,359
same so here we need to use the control

3003
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:12,960
uh which is the control that we got from

3004
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:16,640
the use form context and for example for

3005
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:19,479
the name if I do this I can be able to

3006
02:32:19,479 --> 02:32:20,520
access

3007
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:23,080
to the key that we want because of the

3008
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:26,319
control object that we got from the use

3009
02:32:26,319 --> 02:32:28,439
form hook which is coming from the

3010
02:32:28,439 --> 02:32:31,359
parent component so this is basically

3011
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:33,760
how we can be able to actually track the

3012
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:37,439
elements if we have uh uh custom

3013
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:40,840
component and so let me save the file

3014
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:42,160
and the same thing that we're going to

3015
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:44,720
do for the priority as you can see so

3016
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:47,560
here we're going to get the control um

3017
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,240
uh object and here we're going to create

3018
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,640
the control

3019
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:55,880
uh tag that is coming from the package

3020
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:59,359
and here so instead of using the label

3021
02:32:59,359 --> 02:33:01,200
we're going to use the priority the

3022
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,920
control it's going to equal to the

3023
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:04,720
control the default value is going to be

3024
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:07,040
low and for the render function it's

3025
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,080
going to be the same so the only thing

3026
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:12,120
that is going to be different is uh the

3027
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,120
elements that are associated to the

3028
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:17,920
priority and uh so the same thing for

3029
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:19,880
the stitches as you can see some is

3030
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:22,960
going to get into this so uh there it is

3031
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,359
following the same principle that I

3032
02:33:25,359 --> 02:33:30,880
did for the uh task uh labels so now

3033
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:34,319
when uh after we defined or we installed

3034
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:39,560
the use uh re use react form and uh Zod

3035
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:42,120
uh then we can be able to actually

3036
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:47,200
safely add the task into our

3037
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:50,319
area so now when we

3038
02:33:50,319 --> 02:33:54,160
uh fill up uh the task title so I'm

3039
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:57,120
going to change some of the elements in

3040
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:01,200
these fields and click on add task so as

3041
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,279
you can see we're going to have this

3042
02:34:03,279 --> 02:34:05,800
notification and also the task the new

3043
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:08,319
tck has been updated

3044
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:11,399
successfully and I can do any

3045
02:34:11,399 --> 02:34:15,080
modification that I want I can change uh

3046
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:18,960
the label and can set it to favorite and

3047
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:21,960
also I can copy it just to know that

3048
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:25,160
everything is working as expected and

3049
02:34:25,160 --> 02:34:28,520
also finally I can uh Delete the

3050
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:33,080
elements that I created so the same for

3051
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:34,760
uh this

3052
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:37,560
one so let's go back to the vs code to

3053
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:40,240
show you what I did to be able to create

3054
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,000
this function and the first thing that

3055
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,760
I'm going to start from is the hooks

3056
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:49,399
folder so I'm H uh I created a new a new

3057
02:34:49,399 --> 02:34:52,800
f function called add task inside our

3058
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:56,200
used tasks data store so it's going to

3059
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:59,439
accept as a parameter the task of type

3060
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:01,200
task and that's going to return a

3061
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:05,680
promise of an object uh success as a ban

3062
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:08,240
and the message as a string so it is the

3063
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:11,880
same uh it is the same return as we did

3064
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:15,479
for the update tasks and if we go at the

3065
02:35:15,479 --> 02:35:18,920
bottom of the store so this is the

3066
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:22,120
function so here we are going so of

3067
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:24,080
course the uh function is going to be an

3068
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:26,120
Asing function we're going to use the

3069
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:28,479
try and catch block and here we're going

3070
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:33,279
to simulate the synchronous operation so

3071
02:35:33,279 --> 02:35:35,560
here we're going to create a new promise

3072
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:38,319
and this is the type that we are

3073
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:40,880
expecting to return from the from this

3074
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,920
uh promise and then we're going to use

3075
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:45,359
the resolve method and finally we are

3076
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:48,960
going to create the set timeout of one

3077
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:51,760
uh one second second delay and then

3078
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:54,520
we're going to actually update our state

3079
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:58,080
by using the uh built-in property or

3080
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:01,479
function set from zand so this is going

3081
02:36:01,479 --> 02:36:04,040
to be a function so I'm going to access

3082
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:06,880
to the actual State and then we're going

3083
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:07,960
to be

3084
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:10,960
adding and we're going to make sure if

3085
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:15,240
the task is not null so if it is not

3086
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:17,359
null then we're going to use this turny

3087
02:36:17,359 --> 02:36:19,279
operator to be able to access to this

3088
02:36:19,279 --> 02:36:21,720
plug to be able to add the new task

3089
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:24,200
otherwise we're going to stick with the

3090
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:28,479
task that we currently having inside the

3091
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:31,600
state object and then we are going to

3092
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:36,800
return the uh the tasks uh property uh

3093
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:40,800
in this object of this updated

3094
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,800
tasks and then we're going to actually

3095
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:47,040
return the resolve method or promise

3096
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:49,640
with this object success is true and the

3097
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:53,359
message it's going to be task added

3098
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:55,680
successfully and uh finally we're going

3099
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,720
to return uh the result and if something

3100
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:03,160
bad happens we can we're going to access

3101
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:06,080
to the air block so I'm just uh log in

3102
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,680
this error and we're going to return the

3103
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:11,399
object as a success as false and the

3104
02:37:11,399 --> 02:37:13,560
message failed to add the

3105
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:18,399
task so also I created another hook so

3106
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,920
it's very simp simple one to be able to

3107
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:24,600
just open up uh and close the dialogue

3108
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:27,160
store since we're going to use this uh

3109
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:30,680
to be able to actually um so we're going

3110
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:33,080
to use this when we click on the make a

3111
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:36,040
copy button to be able to open the

3112
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:39,240
dialogue so I need to create a a shared

3113
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:41,560
state so we're going to use zustand for

3114
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:44,439
this and so uh they're very simple

3115
02:37:44,439 --> 02:37:47,399
they're called is open and the set open

3116
02:37:47,399 --> 02:37:49,720
so also we're going to use this this

3117
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:52,800
State inside the task dialogue. GSX as

3118
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:55,479
I'm going to show you so this is the

3119
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:57,880
updated code so here we're going to

3120
02:37:57,880 --> 02:38:00,640
access to the add task function that I

3121
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:03,240
just showed you and here we're going to

3122
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:06,359
add the reset function from methods so

3123
02:38:06,359 --> 02:38:09,319
I'm going to show you why and uh here

3124
02:38:09,319 --> 02:38:11,319
we're going to use the toast element

3125
02:38:11,319 --> 02:38:14,000
from the Ed toast and here we are going

3126
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:17,240
to access to the is open and the set is

3127
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:20,160
open and this we're going to use it for

3128
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:23,600
to show the loading spinner that we

3129
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:28,080
clicked uh on the ad task waiting for uh

3130
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:31,560
for this to be added inside the

3131
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:35,600
area so the is open and the sit open are

3132
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,920
going to be linked to the dialogue as

3133
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,920
you can see uh they're having these

3134
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:44,560
properties open and the on open change

3135
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:46,319
so this one is going to be linked to the

3136
02:38:46,319 --> 02:38:48,560
is open and this one is going to be

3137
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:52,680
linked to the sit is open so uh let's go

3138
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:54,880
back to our function so the first thing

3139
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:56,680
that we're going to be doing so we're

3140
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:59,160
going to update the is loading so first

3141
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:01,680
I want to show you where we are we are

3142
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:04,240
using the is loading so we're using it

3143
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:06,560
inside this button so when the is

3144
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,680
loading is true meaning that we are

3145
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:10,840
waiting for the response we're going to

3146
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:15,200
use this loader uh this loader uh icon

3147
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,840
or spinner and then we're having the

3148
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:20,000
addent task text

3149
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,720
uh otherwise when it is fult we're going

3150
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:25,240
to just use this add new task and uh as

3151
02:39:25,240 --> 02:39:28,120
you can see we're using the is loading

3152
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:31,359
uh inside the disabled property meaning

3153
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:33,520
that when this is true when we are

3154
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:36,000
waiting for a response the button it's

3155
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,040
going to be disabled as I showed you

3156
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:40,760
inside the dialogue so and when it is

3157
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:43,359
getting false then disable it's going to

3158
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:45,120
be false meaning that we can interact

3159
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:46,600
with the button

3160
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:49,399
again so now let's go back to our code

3161
02:39:49,399 --> 02:39:51,200
to continue the code how we are going to

3162
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:54,000
create our task so the first thing that

3163
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,399
we're going to be doing we're going to

3164
02:39:55,399 --> 02:40:00,080
creating a new task object of type task

3165
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:02,240
so the task ID we're going to generate

3166
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:05,920
it by using again or reusing this

3167
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,960
function that we created and for each

3168
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:11,840
element uh it's going to be linked to

3169
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:15,399
the property that we used for the task

3170
02:40:15,399 --> 02:40:17,880
type so the is favorite it's going to be

3171
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:20,479
by default false and and the created add

3172
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:22,560
property we're going to use the new date

3173
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:26,000
to be able to create a date of this

3174
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,560
current time and then we're going to use

3175
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:30,720
the try and catch block so we're going

3176
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:34,000
to actually access or call the add task

3177
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,960
which is an Asing function so that's why

3178
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:39,479
we we use the weight and here as you can

3179
02:40:39,479 --> 02:40:41,600
see we're using the ins saying function

3180
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,359
because you can't use the weight keyword

3181
02:40:44,359 --> 02:40:47,040
within a function and the function is

3182
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,479
still synchronous so it needs to be in

3183
02:40:49,479 --> 02:40:52,000
synchronous and then we are going to

3184
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,120
take this new task and put it in the add

3185
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:58,359
task since it is acceped a prompt and

3186
02:40:58,359 --> 02:41:01,160
then we're going to show the toast

3187
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:03,800
notification based on the results by

3188
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:06,920
using the chain operator so if it is

3189
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:08,680
success we're going to use the default

3190
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:10,880
variant if it is not we're going to use

3191
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:13,399
the destructive variant so the title

3192
02:41:13,399 --> 02:41:16,279
it's going to be result. success and

3193
02:41:16,279 --> 02:41:18,880
here we're going to show the description

3194
02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:22,000
so if this is true we're going to show

3195
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,200
this with the new task. ID as you

3196
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:27,040
noticed otherwise we're going to show

3197
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:30,000
the fail to add the task message and the

3198
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,479
description it's going to be uh the

3199
02:41:32,479 --> 02:41:35,120
result that message that is coming from

3200
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:38,080
the add task function and finally we're

3201
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:41,080
going to use the reset so because when

3202
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:43,800
we click on the add task the window is

3203
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:46,720
closed so we're using the set open as

3204
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:51,439
false and the fields are not being empty

3205
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:54,399
to be able to force being empty we're

3206
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:57,439
going to use the re reset me method from

3207
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:00,640
the react to form Library otherwise if

3208
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,319
there is an error we're going to

3209
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:03,960
actually access to this block and

3210
02:42:03,960 --> 02:42:06,479
finally the S is loading it's going to

3211
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:08,200
be false to

3212
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:12,040
actually set this is loading back to its

3213
02:42:12,040 --> 02:42:14,800
default state so this is how we can be

3214
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:17,560
able to create our task so one last

3215
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:21,000
thing that I need to add is modifying

3216
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:24,279
the TK
